THE ARMATURE</h2>


<p>The armature of a dynamo consists of coils of insulated
wire wound around an iron core, and so arranged that electric
currents are induced in the wire when the armature is rotated
in a magnetic field or the field magnets rotated and armature
held stationary.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The commutator is in fact a part of the armature, but is of sufficient
importance to be considered in a separate chapter.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What are the practical objections to the elementary
armature, described in fig. 165?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It induces a very feeble current, which is not of constant
pressure, but pulsating; that is, it consists of two pronounced
impulses in each revolution as shown in fig. 168.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Why does the elementary armature produce a
pulsating current?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The pulsations are due to the coil moving alternately
into, and out of, the positions of best and least action in the
magnetic field.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How is a continuous current, or one of uniform
pressure obtained?</b></p>

<p>Ans. If an additional coil be added to the elementary armature,
at right angles to the existing coil, and its ends suitably
connected to a four part commutator, as in fig. 185, so that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
one coil is in the position of best action, while the other is in
the position of least action, the pulsations of the resulting
current will be of less magnitude. By increasing the coils
and suitably altering the construction of the commutator to
accommodate the ends of these coils, the resultant current may
be represented by practically a straight line, indicating the
so called <i>continuous current</i>, instead of the wavy resultant
curve No. 6, as illustrated in fig. 187.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
<img id="FIG_247" src="images/fig247.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 247.&mdash;Ring armature of four pole dynamo: diagram of winding and connections, showing
direction of the induced currents. The currents in the windings under the upper N and S
poles are opposed to each other and flow to the external circuit by the positive brush 1,
and back to this half of the armature by the negative brushes 3 and 4. At the same
instant the opposed currents in the lower windings flow to the external circuit by positive
brush 2 and return to the armature through negative brushes 3 and 4. The armature is
thus divided into four circuits and four brushes are required which must be placed between
the poles so as to short circuit the coils as they pass through the neutral space. In this
form of winding there is no difference of potential between the + brushes, so that they are
connected in parallel, as are also the negative brushes, and then to the external circuit.
In multipolar machines there are as many brushes as pole pieces. Since opposite commutator
bars are of the same potential on this four pole dynamo they may be joined by
a cross connecting wire and two brushes, as 2 and 4, dispensed with. This can only be
done when there is an even number of coils. The armature is said to be "cross connected."</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>An armature for practical use has a large number of coils, suitably
arranged upon an iron core, so that a large proportion of them are
always actively cutting the lines of force, or moving into the positions
of best action in the magnetic field.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p><b>Types of Armature.</b>&mdash;Although there are many forms of
armature, all may be divided into three classes, according to the
arrangement of the coils or winding on the core, as:</p>

<p>
1. Ring armatures;<br />
2. Drum armatures;<br />
3. Disc armatures.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Each of these forms of armature has its own special advantages for
particular purposes, the disc type being least in favor and not having
had any extensive application in this country.</p></blockquote>

<div id="FIG_248" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig248.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 248.&mdash;Early form of Gramme ring armature, the core being shown cut through, and some
of the coils displaced to make it clearer. The core, F, consists of a quantity of iron wire
wound continuously to form a ring of the shape shown by the section. Over this is wound
about thirty coils of insulated copper wire, B C D, etc., the direction of the winding of
each being the same, and their adjacent ends connected together. The commutator
segments consist of a corresponding number of brass angle pieces, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, which are fixed
against the wooden boss, <i>o</i>, carried on the driving shaft. The junction of every two
adjacent coils is connected to one of the commutator segments, as shown at <i>n</i>.</p>
</div>


<p><b>Ques. What is the comparison between ring and drum
armatures?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The drum armature is electrically and mechanically
the more efficient, possessing, as it does, possibilities in the
way of better mechanical construction of the core, and in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
arrangement and fixing of the inductors thereon not to be
found in the ring form. Less wire and magnetizing current
are required for the field magnets for a given output than with
the ring armature. Drum winding is not so simple as ring
winding, and it is more difficult to ventilate a drum than a ring
armature, it being necessary to provide special ventilating
ducts.</p>

<div id="FIG_249" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig249.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 249.&mdash;Modern form of Gramme ring armature. The core consists of a number of thin
flat rings of well annealed charcoal iron, the outer diameter of each ring or disc being
11½ inches, and its inner diameter 9¼ inches. Sheets of thin paper insulate each disc
from its neighbors to prevent the flow of eddy currents. The armature is mounted on a
steel shaft to which is keyed a four armed metal "spider," the extremities of whose arms
fit into notches cut in the inner edges of the soft iron core rings, so that a good mechanical
connection is obtained between the core and the shaft. The spider is made of a non-magnetic
metal, to reduce the tendency to leakage of lines of force across the interior of the
armature. The armature inductors consist of cotton covered copper wire of No. 9 standard
wire gauge, wound around the core in one layer, and offering a resistance, from brush to
brush, of 0.048 ohm. There are two convolutions in each section, the adjacent ends of
neighboring sections being soldered to radial lugs projecting from the commutator bars.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. Describe a ring armature.</b></p>

<p>Ans. It consists essentially of an iron ring, around which
is wound a number of coils. These various coils are wound
on separately, the wire being carried over the outside of the
ring, then through the center opening and again around the outside,
this operation being repeated until the winding for that
individual section is completed. The adjacent coil is then
wound in the same way, the ends of each being brought out
to the commutator side of the armature, the arrangement of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
the coils on the ring and connections with the commutator
being shown in <a href="#FIG_247">fig. 247</a>, examples of actual construction being
shown in <a href="#FIG_248">figs. 248</a> and <a href="#FIG_249">249</a>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. For what conditions of operation is the ring
armature specially adapted, and why?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is well suited to the generation of small currents
at high voltage, as for series arc lighting, because the numerous
coils can be very well insulated.</p>

<div id="FIG_250" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig250.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 250.&mdash;Distribution of magnetic lines of force through a Gramme ring. Since the metal
of the ring furnishes a path of least reluctance, most of the magnetic lines will follow the
metal of the ring and very few will penetrate into the aperture of the interior. This
condition causes a serious defect in the action of ring armatures rendering the winding
around the interior useless for the production of electromotive force. Hence, in ring
armatures only about half of the winding is effective, the rest or "dead wire," adding its
resistance to the circuit, thus decreasing the efficiency of the machine.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. Why does a ring armature require more copper
in the winding than a drum armature?</b></p>

<p>Ans. For the reason that those inductors which lie on the
inner side of the iron ring, being screened from practically
all the lines of force, as shown in <a href="#FIG_250">fig. 250</a>, do not generate any
current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Numerous attempts have been made to utilize this part of the winding
by making the pole pieces extend around the ring in such a manner
that lines of force will pass to the inside of the ring, also by arranging
an additional pole piece on the inside of the armature, but mechanical
considerations have shown these methods to be impractical.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. Is any portion of the winding of a drum armature
inactive?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Yes; the end connectors do not generate any current.</p>

<div id="FIG_251" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig251.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 251.&mdash;Illustrating the principle of Siemens' drum winding. In order to make the winding
and connections clear, one coil and the commutator is shown assembled, although the
latter is not put in place until after all the sections have been wound, the ends of the
wires being temporarily twisted together until all can be soldered to the risers. The cores
of these early machines were of wood overspun circumferentially with iron wire before
receiving the longitudinal copper windings.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the chief advantage of the drum armature?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It reduces considerably the large amount of dead
wire necessary with the ring type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How is this accomplished?</b></p>

<p>Ans. By winding the wire entirely on the outer surface of
a cylinder or <i>drum</i>, as it is called, as shown in <a href="#FIG_251">fig. 251</a>, thus
none of the wire is screened by the metal of the core.</p>

<div id="FIG_252" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig252.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 252.&mdash;Elementary four coil drum winding, showing the connections with the commutator
segments, and directions of currents in the several coils. The action of this type of armature
is fully explained in the text.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p><a href="#FIG_252">Fig. 252</a> shows an elementary four coil drum armature. Starting
from the point <i>a</i> and following the winding around without reference at
first to the commutator, it will be found that the rectangular turns of the
wire form a closed circuit, and are electrically in series with one another
in the order of the numbers marked on them.</p>

<p>With respect to the connections to the four segments <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, of
the commutator it will be found that at two of these, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, the
pressures in the windings are both directed <i>from</i>, or both directed
<i>toward</i> the junction with the connecting wire. At the other two segments,
<i>z</i> and <i>w</i>, one pressure is toward the junction and the other directed
from it. If, therefore, the brushes be placed on <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> they will supply
current to an external circuit, <i>z</i> and <i>w</i>, for the moment being idle segments.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p><b>Disc Armatures.</b>&mdash;The inductors of a disc armature move
in a plane, perpendicular to the direction of the lines of force,
about an axis parallel to them as shown in <a href="#FIG_253">fig. 253</a>. The main
difficulty with this type has been in constructing it so that it
will be strong and capable of resisting wear and tear. It was
introduced in an effort to avoid the losses due to eddy currents
and hysteresis present in the other types of armature.</p>

<div id="FIG_253" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig253.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 253.&mdash;Disc armature of Niaudet. It is equivalent to a ring armature, having the coils
turned through an angle of 90&deg;, so that all the coils lie in a plane perpendicular to the axis
of rotation. The connections of the coils with each other and with the commutator remain
the same, the beginning and the end of adjacent coils leading to a common commutator
bar as shown. The magnetic field is arranged by the use of two magnets, so arranged as
to present the north pole of one to the south pole of the other, and <i>vice versa</i>. In the
figure one of these magnets is considered as above the paper, and the other below. If this
armature be rotated through the magnetic field as shown, a reversal of current takes place
in each coil, when it is in such a position that one of its diameters coincides with the pole
line, <i>NS</i>. If the brushes be set so as to short circuit the coils that are in this position, the
armature will be divided into two branchings, the current flowing in an opposite direction
in each, and a direct current will flow in the exterior circuit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On account of the nature of the construction of a disc armature, it
is necessary that the coils subject to induction occupy as small a space
as possible in the direction of their axes. This requirement, as well as
the connection of the inductors with each other and with the commutator,
prevented the general adoption of this form of armature, and subsequent
experience failed to justify the existence of the type.</p></blockquote>

ARMATURE WINDINGS</h2>


<p>To connect up rightly the inductors on an armature so as
to produce a desired result is a simple matter in the case of ring
winding, for bipolar or multipolar machines. It is a less easy
matter in the case of drum winding, especially for multipolar
machines. Often there are several different ways of arriving
at the same result, and the fact that methods which are electrically
equivalent may be geometrically and mechanically
different makes it desirable to have a systematic method of
treating the subject.</p>

<p>The elementary arrangement of drum and disc armatures
has already been considered, which is sufficient explanation
for small armature coils of only a few turns of wire, but in the case
of larger machines which require many coils, further treatment
of the subject is necessary.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For example, in order to direct the winder how to make the connections
for, say a four pole machine having 100 bars spaced around its armature,
some plain method of representing all the connections so that they may
be easily understood is necessary. From this the workman finds out
whether he is to connect the <i>front</i> end of bar No. 1 across to 50 or
across a quarter of the circumference to 24, or across three quarters of
it to bar 75. Again, he ascertains to which bar he is to connect the
<i>back</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>  end of the bar, and how the bars are to be connected to the
commutator.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p><b>Winding Diagrams and Winding Tables.</b>&mdash;In the construction
of armatures, instructions to winders are given in
the form of diagrams and tables. In the tables the letters
F and B stand for <i>front</i> and <i>back</i>, meaning <i>toward</i> the front
end, and <i>from</i> the front end respectively. The letters U and
D stand for <i>up</i> and <i>down</i>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 254.&mdash;End of ring winding for a four pole machine. An end view is simply a view showing
the arrangement of the armature inductors and connections <i>looking from the front or
commutator end</i>. A developed view of the above winding is shown in <a href="#FIG_257">fig. 257</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>There are three kinds of winding diagram:</p>

<p>
1. End view diagram;<br />
2. Radial diagram;<br />
3. Developed diagram.<br />
</p>

<p>The end view is simply a view showing the arrangement of the
armature inductors and connections looking from the front or
commutator end, such as shown in <a href="#FIG_254">fig. 254</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>In the radial diagram the inductors of the armature are
represented by short radial lines, while the end connectors
are represented by curves or zigzags, those at one end of the
armature being drawn within, those at the other end, without
the circumference of the armature. With the radial diagram
it is easier to follow the circuits and to distinguish the back
and front pitch of the winding.</p>

<div id="FIG_255" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig255.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 255.&mdash;Partial sketch of a four pole machine laid on its side. If the observer imagine
himself placed at the center, and the panorama of the four poles to be then laid out flat,
the developed view thus obtained would appear as in <a href="#FIG_256">fig. 256</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The developed diagram is a mode of representation, originally
suggested by Fritsche of Berlin, in which the armature winding
is considered as though the entire structure had been developed
out of a flat surface. This is best explained by aid of <a href="#FIG_255">figs. 255</a>
and <a href="#FIG_256">256</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If in <a href="#FIG_255">fig. 255</a>, which represents an armature core and a four pole field,
wires <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> be placed parallel to the axis of the armature to represent
two of the armature inductors, and moved along the air gap space clockwise
past the S poles, they will cut magnetic lines inducing electromotive
forces in the directions indicated. To attempt to show a large number
of inductors in a drawing of this kind would be unintelligible. Accordingly,
the observer is considered as being placed at the center of the
armature, and the panorama of the four poles surrounding him to
be then laid out flat or "developed" as in <a href="#FIG_256">fig. 256</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>The faces of the N and S poles are shaded obliquely for distinction.
By choosing the proper directions for these oblique lines, a piece of
paper having a narrow slit to represent the wire may be laid over
the drawing of the pole and when moved, as indicated by the dotted
arrows to the right, the slit in passing over the oblique lines will cause
an apparent motion in the direction in which the current in reality tends
to flow. It is easily remembered which way the oblique lines must
slope, for those on the N pole slope parallel to the oblique part of the
letter N.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Lap Winding and Wave Winding.</b>&mdash;In winding armatures
there are two distinct methods employed, known respectively
as <i>lap</i> and <i>wave winding</i>. The distinction arises in the following
manner: Since the inductors, in passing a north pole generate
electromotive forces in one direction, and in passing a south
pole generate electromotive forces in the opposite direction,
it is evident that an inductor in one of these groups ought to
be connected to one in nearly a corresponding position in the
other group, so that the current may flow down one and up the
other in agreement with the directions of the electromotive
forces. The order followed in making these connections gives
rise to lap and wave windings.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is lap winding?</b></p>

<p>Ans. <i>One in which the ends of the coils come back to adjacent
segments of the commutator; the coils of such a winding lap over
each other.</i></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is a wave winding?</b></p>

<p>Ans. <i>One in which the coil ends diverge and go to segments
widely separated, the winding to a certain extent resembling a
wave.</i></p>

wire or inactive inductors on the inside of the ring are shown in dotted lines, the full lines
representing the active portion of the winding.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Angular Pitch or Spread of Drum Coils.</b>&mdash;Before taking
up the winding as a whole, the form of the individual coil should
be considered. <a href="#FIG_260">Fig. 260</a> shows an end view of one coil in position
on a drum armature of a multipolar machine. The two
slots X and Y contain the sides of the coil and the distance
between them on the surface of the drum is called the <i>angular
pitch</i> or <i>spread of the coil</i>. Theoretically this is equal to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
pitch of the poles, represented by the angle M, which is the
angle between the pole centres.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 258 and 259.&mdash;Wooden armature core and
winding table for practice in armature winding. By using strings of
different colors to represent the various coils, the path of each coil is
easily traced when the winding is completed, as in <a href="#FIG_263">fig. 263</a>.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>For instance, on a four pole machine the pitch would be 90&deg;, on a six
pole machine, 60&deg;, etc. Usually the angular pitch of the coil is made
just a little less than the pole pitch of the machine, in order to shorten
the end connections of the coils from slot to slot. However, if the angular
pitch be made too small trouble will be encountered in commutation.</p>

<p>In addition to the angular pitch there is the <i>commutator pitch</i> which
relates to the distance around the commutator bridged by the ends of
the coil. Thus, if the commutator segments were numbered consecutively
1, 2, 3, etc., and the <i>commutator pitch</i> say is 10, it would signify
that one end of the coil was connected to segment 1 and the other end
to segment 11; the ends of the next coil in order then would be connected
to segments 2 and 12, in each case there would be ten segments between
the two segments connecting with the coil ends.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Parallel or Lap Drum Winding.</b>&mdash;In order to avoid much
of the difficulty usually experienced by students of drum winding,
the beginner should construct for himself a wooden armature
core upon which he can wind strings of various colors, or wires
with distinctive insulation, to represent the numerous coils
that are used on real armatures. A few windings attempted in
this way will make clear many points that cannot be so easily
grasped from a written description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p>The type of drum core best adapted for this work is the slotted
variety as shown in <a href="#FIG_258">fig. 258</a>, as it will facilitate the winding.
The core as shown in the illustration has twelve slots and six
commutator segments, the number of each required for the
example of lap winding indicated in the winding table <a href="#FIG_259">fig. 259</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In making the wooden core, the slots may be formed by nailing a series
of thin strips around a cylindrical piece of wood, thus avoiding the
trouble of cutting grooves. In the illustrations the commutator segments
are shortened (leaving no room for brushes) in order to show the connections
as clearly as possible.</p></blockquote>

<div id="FIG_261" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig261.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 261.&mdash;Developed view of a typical lap winding. From the figure it is seen that at the back
of the armature each inductor is united to one five places further on, that is, 1 to 6, 3
to 8, etc., and at the front end of the winding, after having made one "element," as for
example <i>d</i>-7-12-<i>e</i>, then forms a second element <i>e</i>-9-14-<i>f</i> which "laps" over the first, and
so on all around until the winding returns on itself.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the simple lap winding <a href="#FIG_259">fig. 259</a>.</b></p>

<p>Ans. As given in the table, it consists of six loops of wire
presenting twelve inductors on the cylindrical surface of the
core or drum. In the table, six wires are shown, having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
distinctive and varied insulation so as to readily distinguish the
different coils. Opposite these are letters and figures designating
the path and connections of each coil.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the path of the first coil?</b></p>

<p>Ans. According to the table it is:

<br /><br />A &mdash; 1 &mdash; 6 &mdash; B<br /><br />

that is, one end of the wire is connected to commutator segment
A (<a href="#FIG_262">fig. 262</a>) and then wound to the back of the drum through
slot 1, across the back of the drum to slot 6, returning through
this slot, and then connected with commutator segment B.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the path of the second coil.</b></p>

<p>Ans. The second coil, having the block insulation, is wound
according to the table, in the order:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
<br /><br />B &mdash; 3 &mdash; 8 &mdash; C<br /><br />
that is, beginning at segment B, thence to back of drum through
slot 3, across the back to slot 8, returning through this slot and
ending at segment C.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 263.&mdash;View of completed winding as indicated in the table <a href="#FIG_259">fig. 259</a>. Thus the path of the
first coil, according to the table is A-1-6-B which means that the coil begins at segment A of
the commutator, rises to slot 1, and proceeds through the slot to the back of the drum;
thence across the back to slot 6, through the slot and ending at segment B. The other
coils are wound in similar order as indicated in the table.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How are the remaining coils wound on the
drum?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Each of the succeeding coils are wound as indicated
in the table, the last connection being made to segment A, the
one from which the winding started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the general form of the completed
winding?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It may be considered simply as a wire wound spirally
around the drum, with loops brought down to the commutator
segments, and ending at the segment from which the start was
made.</p>

<blockquote>


<p>The completed winding as indicated by the table is shown in <a href="#FIG_263">fig. 263</a>.
Here the path of each coil is easily distinguished by means of the varied
insulations although in part hidden by the drum. <a href="#FIG_264">Fig. 264</a> shows a

from segment <i>d</i> should pass to the rear of the armature along
space 7, but this space is already occupied by the return of the
first coil. Continuing the winding from this point, it would be
necessary to carry the wire from segment <i>d</i> to 6 or 8, <i>resulting in
an unbalanced winding</i>.</p>

slot 4, ending at segment C the starting point of the second coil. Each
coil is wound on in similar manner, the last coil ending at segment A,
the starting point of the first coil. A developed view of the winding is
shown in <a href="#FIG_268">fig. 268</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Double Windings.</b>&mdash;In the various drum windings thus
far considered, each coil had its individual slots, that is, no
two occupied the same two slots. This arrangement gave twice
the number of slots as commutator segments.</p>

<p>In a double winding there are as many segments as slots,
each of the latter containing two inductors, comprising part of
two coils.</p>

<p><b>The Siemens Winding.</b>&mdash;In winding drum armatures for
bipolar dynamos of two horse power or less, and especially for very
small machines as used in fan or sewing machine motors, a
form of winding, known as the Siemens winding, which is shown
in <a href="#FIG_271">fig. 271</a>, is largely used. It consists in dividing the surface
of the armature core in one equal number of slots, say 16, and
using a 16 part commutator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the Siemens winding, the end of the wire used at the start is
to be connected to the first commutator bar, but must be fastened to
the armature core out of the way so as not to interfere with the winding
of the coils.</p>

<p>If eight turns of wire be required to fill a slot with one layer, then the
wire is carried from front to back and bent aside so as to clear the shaft;
after passing across the back or pulley end of the armature, it is wound
in the diametrically opposite section and brought to the front, then
across the commutator end and up close to the beginning of the coil.</p></blockquote>

<div id="FIG_269" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig269.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 269.&mdash;Series connected wave wound ring armature for a four pole machine. The coils
are so connected that only two brushes are necessary.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Since eight turns are to be used, the process of winding is continued
until the section is full and the end of the coil will lie in a position ready
to begin the next section. Sometimes the wire is cut at this part of the
coil leaving 3 or 4 inches projecting for connecting to the commutator
bar 2, or next to the first bar where the winding was started.</p>

<p>The usual practice is, however, to make a loop of the wire of sufficient
length to make the connection to the commutator and it has the advantage
that since all of the coils on the armature are joined in series, the
ending of one coil is joined to the beginning of the next which avoids
making mistakes in making the commutator connections.</p>

<p>If the ends be cut they should be marked "beginning" and "end" to avoid
trouble, because if they get mixed, it will be necessary to test each coil
with a battery and compass needle in order to determine the polarity
produced and find which is the beginning of the coil and which the end.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
With 32 ends of the wire projecting from the end of the armature, it is
confusing and mistakes are often made in the connections, so that one
or more coils may oppose each other which would reduce the voltage.</p>

<p>After the surface of the armature is covered with one layer it will be
noticed that the number of leads from the coils to the commutator bars
is only one-half the number of bars and that they lie on one-half of the
armature.</p>

<p>In order to complete the winding the first layer should be insulated
and the second layer wound on. The beginning of the new coil will be
directly over the first coil put on, but the beginning of the new coil will
be diametrically opposite the beginning of the first coil wound.</p>

<p>The winding is now continued section by section and as each coil is
finished a loop or pair of leads is left to connect to each bar. When the
last coil is wound, its end will be found lying next to the wire used in
starting and should be joined to it and finally connected to bar number
one where the start was made.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What is the objection to the Siemens winding
just described?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It produces an unsightly head where the wires pass
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
around the shaft and requires considerable skill to make it
appear workmanlike.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How may this be avoided?</b></p>

<p>Ans. By using the chord windings of Froehlich or Breguet,
which are improvements over the Siemens in appearance and
are more easily carried out.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 271.&mdash;End view of an armature, showing the distinction between Siemens' winding and
chord winding.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Chord Winding.</b>&mdash;In cases where the front and back pitches<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
are so taken that the average pitch differs considerably from the
value obtained by dividing the number of inductors by the
number of poles, the arrangement is called a chord winding.</p>

<p>In this method each coil is laid on the drum so as to cover an
arc of the armature surface nearly equal to the angular pitch
of the poles; it is sometimes called <i>short pitch winding</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the difference between the Siemens
winding and the chord winding?</b></p>

<p>Ans. This is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_271">fig. 271</a>, which shows one end of
an armature. In the Siemens winding, a wire starting, say at A,
crosses the head and enters the slot marked B. If it enters slot
C it is a chord winding.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe a chord winding.</b></p>

<p>Ans. The winding is started in the same manner as described
in the Siemens method, only instead of crossing the head and
returning in the section diametrically opposite, the section <i>A C</i>,
<a href="#FIG_271">fig. 271</a>, next to it is used for the return of the wire to the front
end. Leads for connecting to the commutator are left at the
beginning and end of each section as before stated and the
only difference between the two methods will be noticed when
the first layer is nearly complete in that two sections lying next
to each other have no wire in them. This will cause the winder
to think he has made a mistake, but by continuing the winding
and filling in these blank spaces in regular order when the two
layers are completed, all the sections will be filled with an equal
number of turns and there will be the required number of leads
from the coils to connect up to the commutator bars.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How many paths in the chord winding just
described?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Two.</p>

<p><b>Multiplex Windings.</b>&mdash;An armature may be wound with two
or more independent sets of coils. Instead of independent
commutators for the several windings, they are combined into
one having two or more sets of segments interplaced around
the circumference. Thus, in the case of two windings, the
brush comes in contact alternately with segments of each set.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
The brush then must be large enough to overlap at least two
segments, so as to collect current from both windings simultaneously.
Both windings then are always in the circuit in
parallel.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of a multiplex winding?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It reduces the tendency to sparking, because only
half of the current is commutated at a time, and also because
adjacent commutator bars belong to different windings.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 272.&mdash;A progressive wave winding. <i>If the front and back pitches of a wave winding be such
that in tracing the course of the winding through as many coils as there are pairs of poles, a
segment is reached in advance of the one from which the start was made, the winding is said to
be progressive.</i> The figure shows three coils of a winding having 18 inductors. From the
definition, the number of coils to consider to determine if the winding be progressive is
equal to the number of poles divided by 2, which in this case is equal to 2. These coils
are shown in the figure as follows: A&mdash;1&mdash;4&mdash;F and F&mdash;11&mdash;14&mdash;B. The second coil ends at
segment B which is in <i>advance</i> of segment A from which the winding began, indicating
that the winding is progressive. Fig. 272 is given simply to illustrate the definition of a
progressive winding, and not to represent a practical winding.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. Does an accident to one winding disable the
machine?</b></p>

<p>Ans. No, it simply reduces its current capacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Can multiplex windings have more than two
windings?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Yes, there may be three or four windings.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the objection to increasing the number
of windings?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It involves an increased number of inductors and
commutator segments, which is undesirable in small machines,
but for large ones might be allowable.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What loss is reduced with multiplex windings?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In these windings, the division of what otherwise
would be very stout inductors into several smaller ones, has
the effect of reducing eddy current loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. For what service are machines with multiplex
windings specially adapted?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Multiplex windings are used in machines intended to
supply large currents at low voltages, such as is required in
electrolytic work.</p>

<p><b>Number of Brushes Required.</b>&mdash;The number of places on
the commutator at which it is necessary or advisable to place a
set of collecting brushes can be ascertained from the winding
diagrams. All that is necessary is to draw arrows marking the
directions of the induced electromotive forces. Wherever two
arrow heads meet at any segment of the commutator, a positive
brush is to be placed, and at every point from which two arrows
start in opposed directions along the winding, a negative brush
should be placed.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How many brushes are required for lap windings
and ordinary parallel ring windings?</b></p>

<p>Ans. There will be as many brushes as poles, and they will
be situated symmetrically around the commutator in regular
order and at angular distances apart equal to the pole pitch.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that the number of brush sets does not necessarily
show the number of circuits through the armature.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How many brushes are required for wave windings?</b></p>

<p>Ans. If arrows be drawn marking the direction of the induced
electromotive forces to determine the number of brushes, it will
be found that only two brushes are required for any number
of poles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the angle between these two brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is the same as the angle between any north and
south pole.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For instance, in a ten pole machine with wave winding the pitch between
the brushes may be any of the following angles:</p></blockquote>

pass around the core in a right or left handed fashion. Thus in fig. 274, in passing around

275, which shows one coil of a drum armature, if <i>a</i> be taken as the starting point, in going
to <i>b</i>, <i>a</i> must be connected by a spiral connector across the front end of the drum to one

<p>Sometimes with lap winding it is desirable to reduce the
number of brushes. In <a href="#FIG_276">fig. 276</a>, is shown the distribution of
currents in a four pole lap wound machine having four brushes
and generating 120 amperes. In each of the four circuits the
flow is 30 amperes, and the current delivered to each brush is
60 amperes. If now two of the brushes be removed, the current
through each of the remaining two will be 120 amperes, while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
internally there will be only two circuits as shown in <a href="#FIG_277">fig. 277</a>. It
should be noted, however, that these two circuits do not take
equal shares of the current since, though the sum of the electromotive
forces in each circuit is the same, the resistance of one
is three times that of the other, giving 90 amperes in one and 30
amperes in the other, as indicated in the figure. If no spark
difficulties occur in collecting all the current with only two
brushes, the arrangement will work satisfactorily, but the heat
losses will be greater than with four brushes.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. Are more than two brushes ever used with wave
winding?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is sometimes advisable to use more than two brushes
with wave windings, especially when the current is very large.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For instance, in the case of a singly re-entrant<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> simplex wave winding
for an eight pole machine, whenever any brush bridges adjacent bars
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
of the commutator, it short circuits one round of the wave winding and
this round is connected at three intermediate points to other bars of the
commutator. Hence, if the short circuiting brush be a positive brush,
no harm will be done by three other positive brushes touching at the
other points. If these other brushes be broad enough to bridge across
two commutator bars, they may effect commutation, that is, three
rounds instead of one undergoing commutation together.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Number of Armature Circuits.</b>&mdash;It is possible to have
windings that give any desired even number of circuits in
machines having any number of poles.</p>

but the heat losses will be greater than with four brushes.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How many paths are possible in parallel?</b></p>

<p>Ans. For a simplex spirally wound ring, <i>the number of paths
in parallel is equal to the number of poles</i>, and for a simplex series
wound ring, <i>there will be two paths</i>. In the case of multiplex
windings <i>the number of paths is equal to that of the simplex winding
multiplied by the number of independent windings</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In large multipolar dynamos it is, as a rule, inadvisable to have more
than 100 or 150 amperes in any one circuit, except in the case of special
machines for electro-chemical work. Such considerations are factors
which govern the choice of number of circuits.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p><b>Equalizer Rings.</b>&mdash;These are rings resembling a series of
hoops provided in a parallel wound armature to eliminate the
effects of "unbalancing," by which the current divides unequally
among the several paths through the armature. By means of
leads, equalizer rings connect points of equal potential in the
winding and so preserve an equalization of current.</p>

<p class="hang">The choice of front and back pitch for a given number of

<p><b>Current Distribution in Ring and Drum Armatures.</b>&mdash;In
studying the actions and reactions which take place in the
armature, the student should be able to determine the directions
of the induced currents. The basic principles of electromagnetic
induction were given in chapter X, from which, for
instance, the distribution of current in the gramme ring
armature, shown in <a href="#FIG_279">fig. 279</a>, is easily determined by the application
of Fleming's rule.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tracing the current from the negative to the positive brush, it will
be seen that it divides, half going through coils 1, 2, 3, and half through
coils I, II, III, these two currents ascend to the top of the ring, uniting
at the positive brush.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. In the Gramme ring armature (<a href="#FIG_279">fig. 279</a>) what
is the distribution of armature currents?</b></p>

<p>Ans. There are two paths in parallel as indicated in <a href="#FIG_279">fig. 279</a>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How does the voltage vary in the coils?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It varies according to the position of the coils, being
least when vertical and greatest when horizontal in a two pole
machine arranged as in <a href="#FIG_279">fig. 279</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The upper and lower coils in the right hand half of the ring armature,
<a href="#FIG_279">fig. 279</a>, will have about the same electromotive force induced in them, say
2 volts each, while the two coils between them will have a higher electromotive
force, at the same instant, say 4 volts each, since they occupy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
nearly the positions of the maximum rate of change of the magnetic
lines threading through them. These eight coils may be represented

<p>For instance, in a four pole machine, as in <a href="#FIG_283">fig. 283</a>, there are four
paths in parallel. In this case the armature may be used to furnish
two separate currents, though this is not desirable.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How are the brushes connected?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Usually all the positive brushes are connected together,

in parallel through the armature as indicated in <a href="#FIG_282">fig. 282</a>.</p>

brushes to one terminal and all the negative brushes to the other which gives

currents can be obtained by omitting the parallel brush connections.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How does this method of brush connection
affect the voltage?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The voltage at the terminals is equal to that of any
of the sets of coils between one positive brush and the adjacent
negative brush.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thus in the four pole machine, <a href="#FIG_283">fig. 283</a>, the coils of the four quadrants
are in four parallels, which gives an internal resistance equal to one-sixteenth
that of the total resistance of the entire ring.</p>

<p>When the coils are connected in two circuits or series parallel, it
requires only two brushes at two neutral points on the commutator,
for any number of poles; this arrangement is shown in <a href="#FIG_269">fig. 269</a>.</p></blockquote>

by use of a single exploring brush and volt meter. It consists in connecting one terminal
of the volt meter (preferably an electrostatic one) to one brush of the machine, and the
other terminal to the exploring brush, which can be moved from point to point, readings
being taken at each point.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 285.&mdash;Cross magnetization. This is defined as lines of magnetic force set up in the windings
of a dynamo armature which oppose at right angles the lines of force created between the
poles of the field magnet. The figure shows this cross flux which is due to the armature
current alone.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How does the voltage vary between successive

<p><b>Cross Magnetization; Field Distortion.</b>&mdash;In the operation
of a dynamo with load, the induced current flowing in the
armature winding, converts the armature into an electromagnet
setting up a field across or at right angles to the field
of the machine. This cross magnetization of the armature
tends to distort the field produced by the field magnets, the
effect being known as <i>armature reaction</i>. To understand the
nature of this reaction it is best to first consider the effect of
the field current and the armature current separately.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_285">Fig. 285</a> represents the magnetic flux through an armature
at rest, where the field magnets are separately excited. If the
armature be rotated clockwise, induced currents will flow
upward through the two halves of the winding between the
brushes, making the lower brush negative and the upper brush
positive.</p>

<p><b>Ques. If, in <a href="#FIG_285">fig. 285</a>, the current in the field magnet
be shut off, and a current be passed through the armature
entering at the lower brush, what is the effect?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The current will divide at the lower brush, flowing
up each side to the top brush. These currents tend to produce
north and south poles on each half of the core at the points
where the current enters and leaves the armature. Hence,
there will be two north poles at the top of the ring and two
south poles at the bottom.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What effect is produced by the like poles at the
top and bottom of the ring?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The external effect will be the same as though there
were a single north and south pole situated respectively at the
top and bottom of the ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. In the operation of a dynamo, how do the poles
induced in the armature affect the magnetic field of the
machine?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They distort the lines of force into an oblique direction
as shown exaggerated in the diagram <a href="#FIG_286">fig. 286</a>.</p>

<div id="FIG_286" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig286.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 286.&mdash;Distortion of magnetic field due to cross magnetization. For clearness, the effect
is shown somewhat exaggerated. A drag or resistance to the movement of the armature
is caused by the attraction of the north and south poles on the armature and pole pieces
respectively.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What effect has the presence of poles in the
armature on the operation of the machine?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In <a href="#FIG_286">fig. 286</a>, the resultant north pole <i>n</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>n</i>, where the
lines emerge from the ring, attracts the south pole, <i>s</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>s</i>, where
the lines enter the field magnet, hence a load is brought upon
the engine, which drives the dynamo, in dragging the armature
around against these attractions. The stronger the current
induced in the armature, the greater will be the power necessary
to turn it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Why does this reaction in the armature require
more power to drive the machine?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The effect produced by the armature reaction is in
accordance with Lenz's law which states that: <i>In electromagnetic
induction, the direction of the induced current is such as
to oppose the motion producing it.</i></p>

filings.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Remedies for Field Distortion.</b>&mdash;Since the distortion of
the magnetic field of a dynamo causes unsatisfactory operation,
numerous attempts have been made to overcome this defect,
as for instance, by:</p>

<p>1. Experimenting with different forms of pole piece;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The reluctance of the pole piece should be increased in the region
where the magnetic flux tends to become most dense. The trailing
horn of the pole piece may be made longer than the advancing horn
and cut farther from the surface of the armature, so as to equalize the
distribution of the magnetic flux.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<p>2. Lengthening the air gap;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This increases the reluctance, and also necessitates more ampere
turns in the field winding. The field distortion, however, will not
be so great, as it would be if the magnetic field of the machine were
weaker.</p></blockquote>

<p>3. Slotting the pole pieces;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Both longitudinal gaps and oblique slots have been tried. The
reduction of cross section of the pole piece causes it to become
highly saturated and to offer large reluctance to the cross field.</p></blockquote>

<p>4. The use of auxiliary poles.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>These are small poles placed between the main poles and so wound
and connected that their action opposes that of the cross field.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Normal Neutral Plane.</b>&mdash;This may be defined as <i>a plane
passing through the axis of the armature perpendicular to the
magnetic field of the machine when there is no flow of current in
the armature</i>, as shown in <a href="#FIG_288">fig. 288</a>. It is the plane in which the
brushes would be placed to prevent sparking when the machine
is in operation were the field not distorted by armature reaction,
and there were no self-induction in the coils.</p>

<p><b>Commutating Plane; Lead of the Brushes.</b>&mdash;It has been
found that in order to reduce sparking to a minimum, the
brushes must be placed in certain positions found by trial and
designated as being located in the <i>neutral plane</i>.</p>

<p>When the brushes are in the neutral plane, they are in contact
with commutator segments connecting with coils that are
cutting the lines of force at the minimum rate.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Define the term "commutating plane."</b></p>

<p>Ans. This is a plane passing through the axis of the armature
and through the center of contact of the brushes as shown
in <a href="#FIG_289">figs. 289</a> and <a href="#FIG_300">300</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the angle of lead?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The angle between the normal neutral plane and the
commutating plane.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the operation of a dynamo since the field, on account of armature
reaction, is twisted around in the direction of rotation, the proper position
for the brushes is no longer in the normal neutral plane, but lies
obliquely across, a few degrees in advance. Hence, for sparkless commutation,
the commutating plane is a little in advance of the normal
neutral plane, the lead being measured by the angle between these
planes, as stated in the definition.</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 288.&mdash;Normal neutral plane. This is a reference plane from which the lead is measured.
As shown, the normal neutral plane lies at right angles to the lines of force of an undistorted
field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to the angle
of lead?</b></p>

<p>Ans. <i>For sparkless commutation, the angle of lead varies with
the load.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>If the field be much altered at full load, it is evident that at half or
quarter-load it will not be nearly so much twisted, hence the necessity
for mounting the brushes on some kind of rocking device which will
allow them to be shifted in different positions for different loads. A desirable
point, then, in dynamo design is to make the angle of lead at
full load so small that it will not be necessary to shift the brushes
much for variation of load. This can be accomplished by making the
field magnet field considerably more powerful than the armature field.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p><b>Demagnetizing Effect of Armature Reaction.</b>&mdash;In the
operation of a dynamo, as previously explained, the position
of the brushes for sparkless commutation must be varied with
the load; that is, for light load they should occupy a position
practically midway between the poles and for a heavy load
they must be moved a few degrees in the direction of rotation.
In other words, the commutating plane must be more or less
in advance of the normal neutral plane as shown in <a href="#FIG_289">fig. 289</a>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of lead?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It produces a demagnetizing effect which tends to
weaken the field magnets.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe this demagnetizing effect in detail.</b></p>

<p>Ans. Tracing the armature currents, in <a href="#FIG_289">fig. 289</a> according
to Fleming's rule, it will be seen that current in inductors 1
to 18 flow <i>from</i> the observer indicated by crosses representing
the tails of retreating arrows and in inductors 19 to 36, <i>toward</i>
the observer from the back of armature, indicated by dots representing
the points of approaching arrows. In determining
these current directions the inductors to the right of the neutral
line are considered as moving downward, and those to the left
as moving upward. The current in inductors 1 to 15 and 19
to 33, tends to cross magnetize the magnetic field of the machine,
but the current in inductors 34 to 36 and 16 to 18 tends to produce
north and south poles as indicated. These poles are in opposition
to the field poles and tend to demagnetize them. Hence,
the inductors lying outside the two upright lines are known as
<i>cross magnetizing turns</i>, and those lying inside, as <i>demagnetizing
turns</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The breadth of the belt of demagnetizing turns included between
the two upright lines is clearly proportional to the angle of lead; therefore,
the demagnetizing effect increases with the lead.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Eddy Currents; Lamination.</b>&mdash;Induced electric currents,
known as eddy currents, occur when a solid metallic mass is
rotated in a magnetic field. They consume considerable energy
and often occasion harmful rise in temperature. Armature
cores, pole pieces, and field magnet cores are specially subject
to these currents.</p>

<div id="FIG_290" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig290.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 290.&mdash;Arago's experiment illustrating eddy currents. Arago found that if a copper disc
be rotated in its own plane underneath a compass needle, the needle was dragged around
as by some invisible friction. The explanation of this phenomenon, known as <i>Arago's
rotations</i>, is due to Faraday, who discovered that it was caused by induction. That is,
a magnet moved near a solid mass of metal, induces in it currents, which, in flowing from one
point to another, have their energy converted into heat, and which, while they last, produce
(in accordance with Lenz's law) electromotive forces tending to stop the motion. Thus,
in the figure, there are a pair of eddies in the part passing between the poles, and these
currents oppose the motion of the disc. Foucault showed by experiment the heating
effect of eddy currents, but such currents were known years before Foucault's experiments,
hence they are incorrectly called Foucault currents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the formation of eddy currents.</b></p>

<p>Ans. In <a href="#FIG_291">fig. 291</a>, a bar inductor is seen just passing from
under the tip of the pole piece N of the field magnet. Noting
the distribution of the lines of force, it will be seen that the
edge <i>c d</i> is in a weaker field than the edge <i>a b</i>, hence, since the
two edges move with the same velocity, the electromotive force
induced along <i>c d</i> will be less than that induced along <i>a b</i>. This
gives rise to whirls or current eddies in the copper bar as
shown.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 291.&mdash;Formation of eddy currents in a solid bar inductor. On account of its appreciable

forces thus produced will induce eddy currents.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What should be noted in seeking a remedy for
eddy currents?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It should be noted that eddy currents are due to
very small differences of pressure and that the currents are large
only because of the very low resistance of their circuits.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Explain this mode of construction with respect
to the bar inductor <a href="#FIG_291">fig. 291</a>.</b></p>

<p>Ans. In the case of a large bar inductor such as shown in
<a href="#FIG_291">fig. 291</a>, it could be replaced by a number of small wires soldered
together only at the ends. The layer of dirt or oxide on the
outside of the wires will furnish sufficient resistance to practically
prevent the eddy currents passing from wire to wire.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 292.&mdash;Eddy currents induced in a solid armature core. Eddy currents always occur when
a solid metallic mass is rotated in a magnetic field, because the outer portion of the metal
cuts more lines of force than the inner portion, hence the induced electromotive force not
being uniform, tends to set up currents between the points of greatest and least potential.
Eddy currents consume a considerable amount of energy and often occasion harmful rise
in temperature.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<p>In <a href="#FIG_293">fig. 293</a>, only five laminations or plates are indicated, so as to show
the sub-division of the eddy currents, but in practical armatures, the
number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 to an inch,
and brings the eddy current loss down to about one per cent. A greater
increase in the number of laminations per inch is not economical, however,
owing to the difficulties encountered in the punching and handling
of extremely thin sheets of iron, and the loss of space between the plates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

<p>Armature cores constructed of the number of plates stated, and
forced together by means of screws and heavy hydraulic pressure, contain
from 80 to 90 per cent. of iron, and have a magnetic flux carrying
capacity only from 5 to 15 per cent. less than when they are made of an
equal volume of solid iron.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Magnetic Drag on the Armature.</b>&mdash;Whenever a current is
induced in an armature coil by moving it in the magnetic field so
as to cut lines of force, the direction of the induced current is
such as to oppose the motion producing it. Hence, in the
operation of a dynamo, considerable driving power is required to
overcome this magnetic drag on the armature.</p>

will occur as shown in <a href="#FIG_295">fig. 295</a>. The resulting mechanical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
actions are easily determined by remembering that <i>the magnetic
lines act like elastic cords tending to shorten themselves</i>. There is
in fact a tension along the magnetic lines and a pressure at right
angles to both, proportional at every point to the square of
their density.</p>

therefore, oppose the motion of the wire; hence, in dynamo operation, more or less power
is absorbed in overcoming this drag on the numerous inductors. In the figure the inductor
is being moved upward against the "drag" due to the magnetic field.</p>
</div>

<p>It is evident by inspection of the lines in <a href="#FIG_295">fig. 295</a>, that there
is a drag upon the conductor in the direction shown by the
arrow.

<p><b>Smooth and Slotted Armatures.</b>&mdash;The inductors of an
armature may be placed on a smooth drum or in slots cut in the
surface parallel to the axis.</p>

<p>In the first instance, the magnetic drag comes on the inductors
and in the case of slots, upon the teeth.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The effect of embedding the armature inductors in slots is to distort
the magnetic field as shown in <a href="#FIG_296">fig. 296</a>. Most of the lines of force pass
through the teeth, thus, not only are the inductors better placed for
driving purposes, but, being screened magnetically by the teeth, the
forces acting on them are reduced, the greater part of the magnetic
drag being taken up by the core.</p>

<p>It should be noted that, although screened from the field, the inductors
in a slotted armature cut magnetic lines precisely as if they were
not protected. The effect is as though the magnetic lines flashed across
the slots from tooth to tooth, instead of passing across the intermediate
slot at the ordinary angular velocity.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Comparison of Smooth and Slotted Armatures.</b>&mdash;The
slotted armature has the following advantages over the smooth
type:</p>

<p>
1. Reduced reluctance of the air gap;<br />
2. Better protection for the winding;<br />
3. Inductors held firmly in place preventing slippage;<br />
4. No magnetic drag on inductors;<br />
5. No eddy currents in inductors;<br />
6. Better ventilation;<br />
7. Opposition to armature reaction.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Due to increased density of flux through the teeth.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang">The disadvantages of slotted armatures may be stated as
follows:</p>

<p class="hang">1. Tendency of the teeth to induce eddy currents in the pole pieces;</p>

<img src="images/fig296.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 296.&mdash;Effect of slotted armature. The teeth, as they sweep past the pole face, cause
oscillations of the magnetic flux in the iron near the surface because the lines in the pole
piece PP tend to crowd toward the nearest teeth, and will be less dense opposite the
slots. This fluctuation of the magnetic lines produce eddy currents in the pole faces
unless laminated. The armature inductors, being screened from the field, are relieved
of the drag which is taken by the teeth.</p>

<p><b>Magnetic Hysteresis in Armature Cores.</b>&mdash;When the

rotates in a bipolar field, the armature core is subjected to
two opposite magnetic inductions in each revolution; that is, at
any one instant a north pole is induced in the core opposite the
south pole of the magnet and a south pole in the core opposite

Accordingly, if the armature rotate at a speed of 1,000 revolutions
per minute, the polarity of the armature will be changed
2,000 times per minute, and result in the generation of heat
at the expense of a portion of the energy required to drive the
armature. This loss of energy is due to the work required to
change the position of the molecules of the iron, and takes place
both in the process of magnetizing and demagnetizing; the
magnetism in each case lagging behind the force.</p>

<p><b>Core Loss or Iron Loss.</b>&mdash;These terms are often employed
to designate the total internal loss of a dynamo due to the
combined effect of eddy currents and hysteresis, but as the losses
due to the former are governed by laws totally different from
those applicable to the latter, special analysis is required to
separate them.</p>

<p>The eddy current loss per pound of iron in the armature core
diminishes with the thinness of the laminated sheets, and
may be made indefinitely small by the use of indefinitely thin
iron plates, were it not for certain mechanical and economical
reasons.</p>

<p>The loss due to hysteresis per pound of iron in the core, does
not vary with the thinness of the core plates; it can be reduced
only by the use of a material having a low hysteretic coefficient.</p>

<p><b>Dead Turns.</b>&mdash;The voltage generated in a dynamo with a
given degree of field excitation is not strictly proportional to
the speed, but somewhat below on account of the various
reactions. That is, the machine acts as though some of its
revolutions were not effective in inducting electromotive force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>

<p>The name <i>dead turns</i> is given to the number of revolutions
by which the actual speed exceeds the theoretical speed for
any output.</p>

<p>Again, this term is sometimes used to denote that portion
of the wire on an armature which comes outside the magnetic
field and is therefore rendered ineffective in inducing electromotive
force. The number of dead turns is about 20% of
the total number of turns.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 297.&mdash;Magnetic hysteresis in armature core. Unlike poles are induced in the core opposite
the poles of the field magnet. Since on account of the rotation of the core the induced
poles are reversed a thousand or more times a minute, considerable energy is required to
change the positions of the molecules of the iron for each reversal, resulting in the generation
of heat at the expense of a portion of the energy required to drive the armature.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Self-induction in the Coils; Spurious Resistance.</b>&mdash;Self-induction opposes a rapid rise or fall of an electric current
in just the same way that the inertia of matter prevents any
instantaneous change in its motion. This effect is produced
by the action of the current upon itself during variations in its
strength.</p>

<p>In the case of a simple straight wire, the phenomenon is
almost imperceptible, but if the wire be in the form of a coil,
the adjacent turns act inductively upon each other upon the
principle of the mutual induction arising between two separate
adjacent circuits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What effect has self-induction on the operation
of a dynamo?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It prevents the instantaneous reversal of the current
in the armature coils. That is, the current tends to go on
and in fact does actually continue for a brief time after the brush
has been reached.</p>

<p class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 298.&mdash;Distribution of magnetic lines through a ring armature. Since the lines follow the
metal of the ring instead of penetrating the interior, no electromotive force is induced
in that portion of the winding lying on the interior surface of the ring. There is, therefore,
a large amount of dead wire or wire that is ineffective in inducing electromotive force;
this is the chief objection to the ring type of armature.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What becomes of the energy of the current at
reversal?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The energy of the current in the section of the winding
undergoing commutation is wasted in heating the wire during
the interval when it is short circuited, and as it passes on, energy
must again be spent in starting a current in it in the reverse
direction. There is, then, a lagging of the current in the armature
coils due to self-induction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is spurious resistance?</b></p>

<p>Ans. This is an apparent increase of resistance in the armature
winding, which is proportional to the speed of the armature,
and due to the lagging of the current.</p>

<p><b>Armature Losses.</b>&mdash;The mechanical power delivered to the
pulley of a dynamo is always in excess of its electrical output on
account of numerous mechanical and electrical losses. Mechanical
losses result from:</p>

<p>
1. Friction of bearings;<br />
2. Friction of commutator brushes;<br />
3. Air friction.<br />
</p>

<p>The electrical losses may be classified as those due to:</p>

<p>
1. Armature resistance;<br />
2. Hysteresis;<br />
3. Eddy currents.<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How do the mechanical and electrical losses
compare?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The mechanical losses are small in comparison with
the electrical losses.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to friction?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The bearing friction varies with the load. In calculating
this loss not only must the weight of the armature be considered
but also the belt tension and magnetic attraction in order to
get the resultant thrust on the bearing. Friction of the brushes
is very small and may be neglected. A small loss of power is
caused by the friction of the air on the armature. The latter,
since it revolves rapidly, acts to some extent as a fan, and in
some machines this fan action is made use of for ventilation and
cooling.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How are the other losses determined?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The loss of power due to armature resistance is easily
found by Ohm's law, but the hysteresis and eddy current
losses, known collectively as <i>iron losses</i>, are not so easily determined.
If the magnetization curve of the particular quality
of iron used for armature plates be known, the hysteresis loss
may be calculated approximately. Eddy current losses are
the most important, especially in large machines. As previously
explained, in all the moving metal masses unless laminated,
there will be eddy currents set up if they cut magnetic
lines. Power may be lost from this cause even in the metal
of the shaft if there be leakage of magnetic lines into it.</p>

COMMUTATION AND THE COMMUTATOR</h2>


<p>The act of commutation needs special study. If it be incorrectly
performed, the imperfection at once manifests itself
by sparks which appear at the brushes. In the study of this
chapter on commutation it would be advisable for the student
to first review the basic principles of commutation as given in
chapter XIV, which contains a brief and simple explanation of
how the alternating current in the armature is converted into
direct current by the action of the commutator.</p>


<p><b>Ques. What is the period of commutation?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The time required for commutation, or the angle
through which the armature must turn to commute the current
in one coil.</p>


<p><b>Ques. Upon what does the period of commutation
depend?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Upon the width of the brushes as shown in <a href="#FIG_300">fig. 300</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This fixes the angle through which the armature must revolve to
commute the current in one coil. This angle is formed, as shown in the
figure, by two intersecting planes, M and S, which pass through the axis
of the armature and the two edges of the brush. Commutation then,
begins at M and ends at S.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the position of the commutating plane
with respect to M and S, in <a href="#FIG_300">fig. 300</a>?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It bisects the angle formed by the planes M and S.</p>

on the thickness of the brush end in contact with the
commutator. Careful distinction should be made between <i>commutating
plane</i>, <i>neutral plane</i>, and <i>normal neutral plane</i> as defined
elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the commutating plane?</b></p>

<p>Ans. An imaginary plane passing through the axis of the
armature and the center of contact of the brush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

position of the brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The normal neutral plane and the commutating plane.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The angle intercepted by these two planes represents the <i>lead</i>, thus
in stating that the brushes have a lead of 6&deg;, means that the angle intercepted
by the normal neutral plane and the commutating plane is 6&deg;.</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 301.&mdash;The proper position of the brushes, if there were no field distortion and self-induction

as shown in <a href="#FIG_302">figs. 302</a> and <a href="#FIG_303">303</a> to secure sparkless commutation.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the difference between the normal

right angles to the plane of maximum induction. This gives the proper position of the
brushes <i>neglecting self-induction</i>.</p>

<img src="images/fig303.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 303.&mdash;Brush adjustment for self-induction. For convenience an electric current is
regarded as having weight and hence possessing the property of inertia. The current
then during commutation cannot be instantly brought to rest and started in the reverse
direction but these changes must be brought about gradually by an opposing force. Hence by
advancing the brushes beyond the neutral plane as illustrated, commutation takes place
with the short circuited coil cutting the lines of force so as to induce a current in the opposite
direction; this opposes the motion of the current in the short circuited coil, brings it to
rest and starts it in the opposite direction, thus preventing sparks. Figs. 301 to 303
should be carefully compared and thoroughly understood.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What should be noted with respect to the
different planes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The commutating plane should be carefully distinguished
from the normal neutral plane and from the neutral
plane, as shown in <a href="#FIG_303">fig. 303</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p><b>Commutation.</b>&mdash;In order to understand just what happens
during commutation, a section of a ring armature may be used
for illustration, such as shown in <a href="#FIG_304">fig. 304</a>. Here the coils A,
B, C, D, E, are connected to commutator segments 1, 2, 3, 4,
and the positive brush is shown in contact with two segments
2 and 3, the brush being in the neutral position. Currents in
the coils on each side of the neutral line flow to the brush through
segments 2 and 3; the brush then is positive.</p>

<div id="FIG_304" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig304.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 304.&mdash;Commutation. This takes place during the brief interval in which any two segments
of the commutator are bridged by the brush. The coil connecting with the two
segments under the brush is thus short circuited. During commutation the current in the
short circuited coil is brought to rest and started again in the reverse direction against
the opposition offered by its so called inertia, or effect produced by self-induction.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, as the armature turns, the commutator segments come
successively into contact with the brush. In the figure, segment
3 is just leaving the brush and 2 is beginning to pass under it,
hence, for an instant the coil C is short circuited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. In <a href="#FIG_304">fig. 304</a>, what are the current conditions?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Previous to contact with segment 2, current flowed
in coil C in the same direction as in coil B.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What occurs while the brush is in contact with
segments 2 and 3?</b></p>

<p>Ans. During this brief interval, the current in C is stopped
and started again in the opposite direction.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Similarly each coil of the armature as it passes the brush will be
short circuited and have its current reversed. This is known as <i>commutation</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of field distortion with respect
to commutation?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The neutral plane no longer coincides with the normal
neutral plane but is advanced in the direction of rotation of
the armature as shown in <a href="#FIG_302">fig. 302</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The reaction of the poles N' and S' of the armature field on the poles
S and N of the main magnetic field tends to crowd the lines of force into
the upper pole face of the south pole of the magnet, and into the lower
pole face of the north pole. This effect is due to the strong magnetic
attraction between the opposite poles S and N' and N and S', and the
equally strong repulsion between like poles N and N' and S and S'. Hence,
the plane of maximum induction no longer coincides with the normal
plane of maximum induction, but is advanced in the direction of rotation,
depending upon the strength of the armature current, being shifted
forward for an increase of current, and backward for a decrease of
current. This distortion of the field and the consequent shifting of the
plane of maximum induction naturally results in the shifting of the
neutral plane from the vertical position to the inclined position as
shown.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Position of the Brushes; Sparking.</b>&mdash;In accordance with
the laws of electromagnetic induction, if the bipolar ring armature
shown in <a href="#FIG_301">fig. 301</a> be rotated in the direction indicated by
the arrow the armature current entering at the brush E will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
divide, one part passing through the coils on the right half of
the ring, and the other part through the coils on the left half
of the ring, to the brush F, from which the total current will
pass out, urged by the full value of the electromotive force
induced in all the coils on both halves of the ring.</p>

<div id="FIG_305" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig305-308.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 305 to 308&mdash;Improper brush adjustment resulting in excessive sparking. When the
brushes are not advanced far enough, commutation takes place before the short circuited
coil reaches the neutral plane, hence, its motion is not changed with respect to
the magnetic field so as to induce a reverse current till after commutation. There is
then no opposing force, during commutation, to stop and reverse the current in the short
circuited coil, and when the brush breaks contact with segment 1, as in fig. 308, the
"<i>momentum</i>" of the current in coil F causes it to jump the air gap from segment 1 to segment
2 and the brush, against the enormous resistance of the air, thus producing a spark
whose intensity depends on the momentum of the current in coil F. Sparking, if allowed
to continue, will injure the brushes and commutator segments.</p>
</div>

<p>Again, if the brushes be placed at the points G and H, each
half of a current entering at G, will pass through one-half of
the coils on the left side and one-half of the coils on the right
side of the ring, so that each half of the current will be urged
forward by an electromotive force equal to the electromotive
force tending to force it back, and therefore, no current will
pass in or out through the brushes. From these considerations
it is obvious that the proper position for the brushes would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
in the normal neutral plane, <i>were it not for the disturbing effects of
armature reaction and self-induction of the current</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Should the brushes of a dynamo be placed in
the neutral plane?</b></p>

<p>Ans. No.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Why not?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The brushes must be advanced beyond the neutral
plane to prevent sparking.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the cause of sparking at the brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is due to <i>self-induction</i> in the coil undergoing commutation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Explain the effect of self-induction in detail.</b></p>

<p>Ans. When commutation takes place with the brushes in
the neutral plane as in <a href="#FIG_304">fig. 304</a>, there will be no voltage induced
in the short circuited coil C. The current, therefore, which
flowed in coil C before it was short circuited will cease, and as
segment 3 breaks contact with the brush, it will be thrown as a
perfectly idle coil upon the right hand half of the ring in which
a current is flowing toward the brush. Moreover, the current
which was flowing through D and 3 directly to the brush, must
suddenly traverse the longer path through the idle coil C. Now,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
on account of self-induction, <i>the current acts in precisely the same
manner as though it had weight</i>; that is:</p>

<h3><i>It cannot be instantly stopped or started.</i></h3>

<div id="FIG_309" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig309-313.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 309 to 313.&mdash;How sparkless commutation is obtained by advancing the brushes
beyond the neutral plane; commutation progressively shown.</p>

<p id="FIG_310" class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 310.&mdash;Segment 2 has come into contact with the brush and coil F, in which commutation
is taking place, is now short circuited. The current now divides at M, part passing to the
brush through segment 2, and part through coil F and segment 1. Although coil F is
short circuited and having passed the neutral plane, is cutting the lines of force so as
to induce a current in the opposite direction, it still continues to flow with unchanged
direction against these opposing conditions. This is due to <i>self-induction</i> in the coil which
resists any change just as the momentum of a heavy moving body, such as a train of
cars, offers resistance to the action of the brakes in retarding and stopping its motion.</p>

<p id="FIG_311" class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 311.&mdash;Segment 2 has moved further under the brush, and the opposition offered to the
forward flow of the current in the short circuited coil F by the reverse induction in the
magnetic field to the right of the neutral plane has finally brought the current in F to
rest. The currents from each side of the armature now flow direct to the brush through
their respective end segments 1 and 2.</p>

<p id="FIG_312" class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 312.&mdash;Segment 1 is now almost out of contact with the brush. A current has now been
started in the coil F in the reverse direction due to induction in the magnetic field to the
right of the neutral plane; it flows to the brush through segment 2. The current has
not yet reached its full strength in F, accordingly, part of the current coming up from
the right divides at S and flows to the brush through segment 1.</p>

<p id="FIG_313" class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 313.&mdash;Completion of commutation in segments 1 and 2; the brush is now in full contact
with segment 2, the current in coil F has now reached its full value, hence the current
flowing up from the right no longer divides at S but flows through F and segment 2 to
the brush. If the current in F had not reached its full value, at the instant segment 1
left contact with the brush, it could not immediately be made to flow at full speed any
more than could a locomotive have its speed instantly changed. This, as previously
explained, is due to self-induction in the coil or the so called "inertia" of the current which
opposes any sudden change in its rate of flow or direction. Accordingly that portion of the
current which was flowing up from the right and passing off at S to the brush through
segment 1 as in fig. 312, would, when this path is suddenly cut off as in fig. 313, encounter
enormous opposition in coil F. Hence, it would momentarily continue to flow through
segment 1 and jump the air gap between this segment and the brush, resulting in a more
or less intense spark depending on the current conditions in coil F. </p>
</div>

<p>Therefore, when segment 3 leaves the brush, the current
will not instantly change its path and flow through C, but will be
urged by its "<i>momentum</i>," and jump the air gap between the
brush and segment 3, thus producing a spark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How may this sparking be prevented?</b></p>

<p>Ans. If the brushes be given additional lead, that is shifted
further to the right to some position as N N, <a href="#FIG_304">fig. 304</a>, coil C
will not remain idle during the interval it is short circuited,
<i>but will cut the magnetic lines in such a way as to induce a current
in the reverse direction through it</i>. Under these conditions, when
segment 3 breaks contact with the brush, the current flowing
through D does not encounter an idle coil, but one in which
a current is flowing in the same direction, hence, the tendency
to jump the air gap and produce a spark is reduced; with proper
adjustment of the brushes, there will be no sparking.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the objection to very thin brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Time must be allowed for reversal of the current,
hence the brushes must not be so thin as merely to bridge the
insulation between segments.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of lead?</b></p>

<p>Ans. There is usually much sparking when the lead is too
small; a little sparking when too great, and no sparking when
just right. If the lead be excessive, there is a waste of energy
due to the generation of a larger reverse current in the short
circuited coil than is necessary.</p>

<p><b>Fixed Position of Brushes.</b>&mdash;The condition for sparkless
commutation is that the current in the short circuited coil be
reduced to zero, and increased in the opposite direction up to
the same value as that in the next coil leading. If the brushes
are to remain in a fixed position, this condition will only be
realized at the particular load for which the brushes are set.
Thus, if the brushes be set for the average load, the reversing
field will not be correct for either a weaker or stronger load.
Hence, sparkless commutation with fixed brushes must be due to
some other factor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to carbon
brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Since carbon possesses a high resistance, the drop
will vary greatly with the contact area, thus affecting a difference
of potential in the two segments passing under the brush and it
is largely to this that sparkless commutation is due.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of resistance on commutation?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In <a href="#FIG_304">fig. 304</a> during commutation, that is, while the
brush contacts with any two segments, as 2 and 3, the currents
coming up through the winding on either side of the neutral
plane are offered two paths to the brush: 1, direct to brush
through the connecting segment, or 2, across the short circuited
coil and adjacent segment. Thus, on the right side:
to brush through segment 3, or across coil C and adjacent segment
2.</p>


<h3><i>The current will take the path of least resistance.</i></h3>

<p>At the beginning of commutation, almost the entire brush
area being in contact with segment 3, the contact resistance of
this segment will be much less than for segment 2; hence, not
only will the current at the right flow through 3, but also the
current at the left after first traversing the short circuited coil.
As commutation progresses, the area of contact of 3 decreases
while that of 2 increases, and the respective resistances vary
in inverse proportion. Likewise the tendency of the current
in the left half of the winding to take the longer path through
coil C and segment 3 to the brush gradually decreases, becoming
zero when the two contact areas become equal. During the
second half of the period of commutation, the contact area of
segment 2 becomes greater and of 3, less; thus the resistance of
2 is lowered, and that of 3 increased. Accordingly, all of the
current at the left will flow through segment 2, and the current
at the right will flow through C and 2 rather than through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
3. In this way the current is reversed in C, and, if the brush be
broad enough to allow a sufficient time interval, the current
in C is built up to its full value before segment 3 leaves the
brush, thus securing sparkless commutation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This contact resistance factor in sparkless commutation is illustrated
in <a href="#FIG_314">figs. 314</a> to <a href="#FIG_318">318</a>, it being assumed that during commutation, the
brush contact resistance is inversely proportional to the area of contact,
and that the winding is free of resistance and inductance. The current
is taken as 40 amperes, in which case 20 amperes will flow from each
side of the winding to the brush.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FIG_314">fig. 314</a> the instant before commutation begins all the current will
flow through segment A. At the end of the first quarter of the period
of commutation, <a href="#FIG_314">fig. 315</a>, 30 amperes will flow from the right to brush
through A, and from the left, 10 amperes through the short circuited
coil via A and 10 amperes through B.</p>

<p>At the end of the second quarter or half period, <a href="#FIG_314">fig, 316</a>, the current
through each half of the winding will flow to the brush through these
respective segments.</p>

<p>At the end of the third quarter, <a href="#FIG_314">fig. 317</a>, the current from the right
will divide, 10 amperes going through A, and 30 amperes traversing
the short circuited coil and out through B. The entire current from
the left will flow through segment B.</p>

<p>At the end of the fourth quarter, <a href="#FIG_314">fig. 318</a>, or completion of the period the
current from each half of the winding will flow to the brush through B.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of increasing the degree of
contact of the brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It lengthens the period of commutation, and permits
it to start in one coil before the preceding coil has entirely
passed through this stage.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The effect of changing the degree of contact is shown in <a href="#FIG_319">figs. 319</a> to
<a href="#FIG_319">323</a>, in which the width of the brush is made equal to that of two segments.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Construction of Commutators.</b>&mdash;The commutator for a
closed coil armature consists of a number of segments or L-shaped
bars C of drop forged hard-drawn copper assembled
around a tubular iron hub as shown in <a href="#FIG_324">figs. 324</a> and 325. The bars are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
held in position by the nuts E, and washers F, screwed on
the ends of the tube D. The bars are insulated from each other
and from the washers by mica as shown by the heavy lines G,
and they are also insulated from the tube either by a tube of
mica H, or by a sufficient air space. The ends of the sections
of winding are connected to the vertical portions of the bars
K, by insertion in the slots L, where they are securely held in
place by means of the binding screws, which for greater security
are soldered together, and may be released from the slots,
whenever necessary, by the application of a hot soldering iron.</p>

<div id="FIG_324" class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 324 and 325.&mdash;Side and end sectional views of commutator showing construction.
The parts are: C, segments; D, tubular iron hub; E, end nuts; F, clamps; G, insulation;
L, riser connection.</p>
</div>

<p>It is very important that all the parts of the commutator
should be fitted together perfectly and screwed up tightly, in order
to prevent looseness. Commutator segments are often made
with the washers E, projecting beyond the ends, but such
construction reduces the effective length of the commutator,
therefore the under cut form of bar is preferable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>

<p>In the construction of commutators, the conditions of operation
require that there be:</p>

<p>1. Adequate insulation;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is necessary to have good insulation between each segment, and a
specially good insulation between the segments and the hub or sleeve on
which they are mounted; also between the segments and end clamps.
The insulating material must not absorb moisture, hence asbestos,
plaster, or vulcanized fibre are not used. The end insulating rings are
usually built up of mica and shellac, moulded while hot under pressure
to the correct shape.</p></blockquote>

is made of hard-drawn copper and insulated throughout, ventilating spaces being
provided near the shaft.</p>
</div>

<p>2. Rigidity against centrifugal force;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Since the segments are subject to centrifugal force, they must be securely
clamped in place. Screws cannot be used, for that would destroy the
insulation. They are therefore held in place by insulated clamps as
shown in <a href="#FIG_324">fig. 324</a>. These clamps should be strong and capable of holding
the segments firmly in position, for if a segment should rise out of
its place through centrifugal force, it would disturb the action of the
brush and cause sparking.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<p>3. Provision for wear.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The segments should be of considerable radial depth, so that the commutator
may be turned down from time to time to preserve its circular
form.</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 327.&mdash;Sectional view of a General Electric commutator. The segments are of rolled or
forged copper and are separated by soft mica insulating sheets. This mica must wear
down evenly with the copper, hence its consistency is important. The segments are
wedge shaped so that when drawn radially inward they support each other like the stones
of an arch. They are drawn together by hollow cone collars which bear upon lugs projecting
from the ends of the segments. These lugs are turned to form a smooth cone
after the segments are assembled. The collars are insulated with mica from the segments
and they are held in place by nuts upon the commutator shell or by bolts passing
from end to end under the segments. The segments are also provided with lugs for
connection to the windings.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Points Relating to Commutators.</b>&mdash;1. The number of
commutator segments depends on the scheme of winding and
on the number of sections in the armature winding.</p>

<p>2. Increasing the number of bars diminishes the tendency
to spark, and lessens the fluctuations of the current.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are two practical reasons for not using a very great number
of segments: it increases the cost, and in small machines the segments
would be so thin that a brush of the proper thickness to collect the
current would lap over, or bridge several segments.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p><b>Types of Commutator.</b>&mdash;Commutators are made in various
forms, but they may be grouped into two general types:</p>

<p>1. Commutators for closed coil armatures;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>These consist of a large number of segments or bars, insulated from
each other and varying in number according to the scheme of armature
winding, and on the number of sections into which that winding is
grouped.</p></blockquote>

with copper brushes, whose conductivity is much higher than carbon, the commutator
must be of considerable size to give the required brush contact area. The contrast
between the axial lengths of the armature and the commutator is very marked. The
rocker construction is of the ordinary type, and heavy flexible cables conduct the current
from the brush holders to the fixed terminals. The machine here illustrated gives 310
amperes at 7 volts when running at a speed of 1400 R. P. M., corresponding to an output
of 2.17 kilowatts.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>

<p>2. Commutators for open coil armatures;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This form of commutator is used on some machines designed especially
for arc lighting, such as the Brush and Thomson-Houston machines.
They consist of a comparatively small number of segments each of
which covers a wide angle, and are separated from each other by air
gaps.</p></blockquote>

<p>3. The segments should be of considerable depth to permit
returning occasionally so that their circular form may be preserved;</p>

<p>4. The insulating material must be such that it will not
absorb oil or moisture;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mica is best adapted for insulation, but as there are a great many
varieties, differing greatly in hardness and other equalities, it is important
to select the kind that wears at the same rate as the segments. If the
mica be too hard, the wearing of the segments will leave it projecting
and prevent proper contact with the brushes; again, if the mica be too
soft, it will result in furrows or depressions between the segments into
which copper dust will collect, causing short circuits.</p></blockquote>

BRUSHES AND THE BRUSH GEAR</h2>


<p>With respect to construction, brushes may be broadly classified
as: 1, those made of metal, and; 2, those made of carbon.
There are several varieties of metal brush, such as:</p>

<p>
1. Gauze brushes;<br />
2. Wire brushes;<br />
3. Laminated or strip brushes.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Gauze Brushes.</b>&mdash;These are very flexible and yielding,
their use being attended with little wear of the commutator.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the construction of a gauze brush?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A gauze brush is made up of a sheet of copper gauze,
folded several times, with the wires running in an oblique
direction, so as to form a solid flat strip of from ¼ to ½ inch
in thickness, increasing with the volume of the current to be
collected.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the object of folding the gauze with the
wires running in oblique directions?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is to prevent the ends of the brush fraying or
threading out, which would be the case if the gauze were folded
up in any other manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the features of gauze brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They make good contact, but are quite expensive.
They may be set either tangentially or radially, the latter
preferably, since the point of contact remains the same as the
brushes wear away.</p>

<div id="FIG_329" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig329-332.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 329 to 332.&mdash;Various forms of brush. Fig. 329 gauze brush; fig. 330 laminated or
strip brush; fig. 331 strip and wire brush as used on the early Edison machines; fig. 332
carbon brush. Carbon is preferred to copper for brushes on account of the reduction
of sparking secured by its use.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Wire Brushes.</b>&mdash;This class of brush, which was extensively
used before the invention of the gauze brush, is made up of a
bundle of brass or copper wires, laid side by side and soldered
together at one end. Since wire brushes are harder than the
gauze brush, they are more liable to cut or score the commutator,
and are also more troublesome to trim.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<p><b>Laminated or Strip Brushes.</b>&mdash;These probably represent
the simplest form of brush, but are not extensively used owing
to the lack of flexibility. They consist of a number of strips of
copper or brass, laid one upon the other and soldered at one end,
as in <a href="#FIG_329">fig. 330</a>.</p>

<div id="FIG_333" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig333.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 333.&mdash;General Electric brush holder. The
brush holder yoke consists of a cast iron ring of elliptical section,
supported from the bracket of the end shield in such a manner as to
facilitate the shifting of the brushes. It is provided with a suitable
handle, and may be fastened in any position by means of a thumb nut on the
outside of the bracket. It is so constructed that the tension on the
individual brush can be adjusted without lifting the brush from the
commutator and without the use of tools. The brush can be removed while
the machine is running, without moving the holder on the stud and without
disturbing any other brush. Removal of the brushes for inspection can be
accomplished without permanent change in the adjustment of the tension of
the brush holder spring. The connection between the brush and stud is made
through a flexible copper connection.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What name is generally given to strip brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are commonly and erroneously called <i>tangential
brushes</i>, but they are really beveled at the end and set inclined
to the line of tangency so that the ends of all the sheets will
make contact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the Brush and Thomson-Houston arc dynamos, in which the current
is limited to ten amperes, the brushes consist of a simple strip of
flexible sheet copper, the ends of which are slit in a number of places
so as to insure contact at several points.</p></blockquote>

<img src="images/fig334.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 334.&mdash;Crocker-Wheeler brush holder. The carbon brush B is firmly clamped in the
"box" C by two screws which bear on a sheet of brass to protect the carbon from being
broken by the ends of the screws. The box C is carried by four flexible springs S S, one
at each corner and formed of hard copper leaves. These are fixed at one end to the box and
at the other to the solid base which is in one piece with the spoke attached to the rocker
ring. An adjusting screw passes through appropriate lugs on the box C and loosely
through the head A of a fixed arm <i>a</i>. Between the lower surface of <i>a</i> and the upper
lug on the box C is placed the pressure spring.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Carbon Brushes.</b>&mdash;When metallic brushes are used upon
the commutators of high tension machines, they frequently
give rise to excessive sparking and also heating of the armature,
the metallic dust given off appearing to lodge between the
segments of the commutator, thus partially short circuiting the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
armature. To obviate this, carbon brushes are extensively used
in such dynamos, this material being found very effectual in
the prevention of sparking.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the usual form of carbon brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are usually in the form of oblong blocks.</p>

<div id="FIG_335" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig335.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 335.&mdash;Perspective views of Crocker-Wheeler brush holder. This holder is of the parallel
type in which the brushes may be adjusted without affecting the lead. Each brush is held
rigidly in its box and there are no sliding contacts in the path of the current. The holder
is further described under <a href="#FIG_334">fig. 334</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How are they adjusted on the commutator?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are set "butt" end on the commutator, and fed
forward as they wear away by means of a spring holder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Why are carbon brushes so extensively used?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Because they are the only form of brush that will
give good commutation with fixed lead.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said of the different grades of
carbon in use for brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The very soft carbon leaves a layer of graphitic matter
on the commutator, and at high voltages, this may cause sparking;
such grade of carbon should only be used on low voltage
machines.</p>

<div id="FIG_336" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig336.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 336.&mdash;Western Electric box type brush holder. The box which holds the brush is broached
to allow the brush to slide freely, but not loosely, to and from the commutator against
which it is normally held by a lever acting directly upon the brush head. This avoids the
possibility of uneven bearing on the commutator, as the brushes are allowed very slight
lateral or angular motion. The adjustment of a brush is also simplified after it has been
removed and then replaced. Tension on the brush head is obtained by a special spring
which maintains any given tension for which it may be set. An auxiliary flat steel spring
on the lower side of the lever acts as a shock absorber between the lever and the brush
head, absorbing all minor vibrations caused by a worn commutator. Side contact between
brush and brush holder is not relied upon to carry the current, flexible copper pigtails
performing this function to the exclusion of sliding contacts or tension springs, in order to
reduce the brush loss. It is not necessary to take the brush rigging apart or loosen cable
connections when it is desired either to remove or reverse the brushes to change the direction
of armature rotation.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How are the ends of carbon brushes treated
and why?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are usually covered at their upper part with
a coating of electro-deposited copper to insure good contact with
the holder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

<p><b>Comparison of Copper and Carbon Brushes.</b>&mdash;Copper
brushes tend to tear and roughen the surface of the commutator,
while carbon brushes tend to keep the surface smooth.
Copper causes more wear of the commutator than carbon. With
carbon brushes, the armature may be run in either direction.
The resistance of carbon being greater than copper, there is less
short circuiting caused by carbon particles than by those of
copper.</p>

<div id="FIG_337" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig337.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 337.&mdash;Westinghouse brush holder. It is made of brass, cast in one piece, and of standard
sliding type with a shunt of braided copper wire directly connected to a clamp on each
brush and to the solid portion of the holder, where it is held by a screw. This shunt relieves
the spring of heavy currents. The holder is so arranged as to be easily accessible for
adjustment, cleaning and renewal of carbons. Proper tension is provided by spiral strap
springs so mounted as to eliminate friction and give uniform pressure over a wide working
range. The spring tension is readily adjusted by a simple ratchet arrangement.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the chief merit of carbon brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They give less sparking than other types.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How has the construction of carbon brushes
been varied?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Since, for minimum sparking, it is only necessary that
the brush have high resistance in the region near its edge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
attempts have been made to increase the conductivity of the
other portions by combining with the carbon, copper sheets or
wires.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the objections to carbon brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are easily broken and not being flexible, vibration,
or any roughness of the commutator will cause bad contact.</p>

<div id="FIG_338" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig338.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 338.&mdash;Holzer Cabot multiple brush holder. Each brush is fastened securely to a machined
surface by one or two machine screws, making a positive contact. Several strips of
flexible copper of ample section to carry the current are interposed between the part of the
holder carrying the brush and the portion clamping the stud, no sliding contact or spring
being therefore required to carry any current. The brushes are proportioned for a carrying
capacity of not more than 25 amperes per square inch of brush surface. The brush can be
adjusted to any degree of tension during the operation of the machine if necessary. Each
holder is insulated in such a manner that no short circuit can occur if the holder be accidentally
tipped backward while the operator is changing a brush or cleaning the commutator
during a run.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. For what class of machine are carbon brushes
specially adapted?</b></p>

<p>Ans. For machines furnishing a small current at high pressure.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When carbon brushes are used, it is desirable that the current be small,
because, on account of the low conductivity of the carbon, more contact
area is necessary than with copper for equal current transmission. For
fixed lead and fluctuating currents, carbon brushes should be used.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. For what class of machine are copper brushes
especially adapted?</b></p>

<p>Ans. For machines furnishing large current at low pressure,
as in <a href="#FIG_328">fig. 328</a>.</p>

<p><b>Size of Brushes.</b>&mdash;The number of brush sets depends upon
the number of poles of the machine, but there may be several
brushes in each set. It is usual, except in the smallest machines,
to place at least two brushes exactly similar side by side instead
of one broad brush, thus allowing one brush to be removed for
trimming or renewal while the machine is running. Moreover,
better contact is secured by this sub-division, because a slight
elevation in the commutator surface at one point may slightly
raise one brush of a set at each revolution without much harm,
while with one broad brush, the entire brush would be lifted,
causing bad sparking.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What determines the number of brushes in each
set?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It depends upon the current capacity, size of machine,
and judgment of the designer.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to the dimensions
of the brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. No general rule can be given for breadth and thickness
of brush. The contact face must clearly be wider than the
thickness of the insulation between commutator segments, since
the period of commutation must last an appreciable interval of
time on account of self-induction.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What should be the minimum width of the
brush contact face?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It may be taken as one and one-half times the thickness
of the commutator segments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How wide should a carbon brush contact be?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The brush should be thick enough to cover two and
one-half commutator segments. The thickness should in no
case be excessive on account of the loss due to heating, which
results from the difference of potential at the forward and rear
edge of the brush.</p>

holders, and inclined opposite to the direction of rotation when used with reaction holders.</p>

<p><b>Contact Angle of Brush.</b>&mdash;This may be defined as the angle
which the brushes make with the commutating plane as shown

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<p>Wire or gauze brushes should make a more or less acute angle as at B, in
order to present the end and not the side of the brush to the commutator.</p>

<p>Carbon brushes may be placed end on or radially as at C, which is
the position almost universally used in the case of traction or other
reversing motors.</p>

<p>Sometimes the carbon brush is inclined as at D, in order that the revolving
commutator may tend to push the brush against its supports
and thus ensure better contact.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Brush Contact.</b>&mdash;The relation between <i>contact pressure,
contact resistance</i>, and <i>friction</i> of brushes varies greatly for
different kinds of brush. Copper brushes will carry from 150
to 200 amperes per square inch of contact surface; and carbon
brushes from 40 to 70 amperes per square inch. The usual contact
pressure is 1.25 to 1.5 pounds per square inch for copper
brushes, and 1.5 to 2 pounds per square inch for carbon brushes.
The rim velocities of commutators vary from 1,500 to 2,500 feet
per minute, the velocity usually increasing with the size of the
machine.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 340.&mdash;Bissell double brush holder. Flexible cables carry the current between the brushes
and holders. This holder works equally well for forward or reverse rotation. Two or more
holders are used on each stud except for the two smallest frames. The construction permits
of adjustment or renewal of brush while the machine is in operation. Sufficient
contact area of brush is provided to permit running on one carbon at ordinary loads in
case the other become worn or inoperative.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the drop in voltage at the brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. For carbon brushes it is about 0.8 to 1.0 volt at each
contact, or 1.6 to 2.0 volts for the two, positive and negative,
contacts of a machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This value is not materially affected by placing a number of brushes
in parallel or by using several sets, as in the case of multipolar machines,
as such arrangement merely reduces the current density, and since
the contact resistance varies in the inverse ratio, their product remains
nearly constant.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said of the friction of the brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The coefficient of friction of brushes is about .2 to .25
for copper and .3 for carbon.</p>

<div id="FIG_341" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig341.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 341.&mdash;Western Electric brush gear. The brush holders carry carbon brushes and are so
designed that the brushes may be firmly clamped in position and also be capable of independent
adjustment. Any brush can be removed while the machine is in operation without
disturbing the others and without moving the holder on the stud.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How many watts are lost at the brushes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The watt loss is equal to 1.6 to 2. volts for carbon
multiplied by the total current carried.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The watt lost on account of friction may be calculated by the formula:
((.3 x 746)/33000) × (P x S) = watts lost by carbon friction, in which P
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
is the total pressure in pounds on the commutator, and S, the rim
velocity of the commutator in feet per minute.</p>

<p>The losses due to contact resistance and brush friction are very liable
to be greatly increased above the values that may be obtained by the
preceding methods, if the commutator and brushes are dirty and rough,
or not in good condition.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p><b>Brush Holders.</b>&mdash;These are devices employed to hold the
brushes against the commutator with the proper pressure.
They differ considerably in various types of machine, hence, no
general rules can be given with respect to their construction or
use, but any brush holder must fulfill the following requirements:</p>

<p class="hang">1. It must hold the brush securely and at the same time feed
it forward as it wears away so as to maintain a proper contact;</p>

<p class="hang">2. It must hold the brush at the proper contact angle;</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p class="hang">3. It must be capable of being raised from the commutator,
and held out of contact by some form of catch;</p>

<p class="hang">4. It must be so constructed that the brush can be easily
removed for cleaning or renewal;</p>

<p class="hang">5. The spring pressure must be adjustable;</p>

<p class="hang">6. The brush holders themselves must be carried on a rocker
arm, or rocker ring.</p>

<p>It is desirable that brush holders be capable of individual
adjustment, so that each may be set at its own point of minimum
sparking. A few forms of brush holder are illustrated in figs.
342 to 345.</p>

<p>The various kinds of brush holder may be divided into four
types:</p>

<p>
1. Arm or lever type;<br />
2. Spring arm type;<br />
3. Box type;<br />
4. Reaction type.<br />
</p>

<p>In the arm or lever type the brush is firmly attached to the
extremity of a rigid arm capable of movement about the brush
spindle, except in so far as it is restrained by a spring as in <a href="#FIG_342">fig. 342</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_342">Fig. 343</a> shows a brush holder of the spring arm type. The
brush is firmly attached to the extremity of a spring arm, the
other end of which is secured to the brush spindle, and when
once adjusted is not capable of movement about the brush
spindle.</p>

<p>In the box type of brush holder as illustrated in <a href="#FIG_342">fig. 344</a>,
the brush is free to move up and down in the brush box, so far
as it is not restrained by a spring rigidly secured to the arm
which carries the brush box at its extremity.</p>

from thin sheet steel, annealed and japanned. Spacing ribs are built into the core at
proper intervals forming air passages for ventilation. In addition, there are recesses in
the inside of the flanges which permit the passage of air from the interior around the
ends of the core to the openings in the end flanges. The armature coils are constructed
of round or bar copper on standard forms. The coils are laid in slots in the surface of the
core. The commutator is constructed of bars of hard-drawn copper of uniform size and
shape, supported and clamped at either end between beveled rings and securely seated on
the commutator drum. The drum is connected by radial arms to the commutator sleeve
which is mounted and keyed on the armature hub extension.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>

<p><a href="#FIG_342">Fig. 345</a> shows the reaction type of brush holder, in which the
movement of the brush is constrained in one direction by the
surface of a part rigidly secured to the brush spindle, and is
further constrained by a spring controlled arm, the pressure of
which is capable of ready adjustment.</p>

<p>Among the special forms of brush holder may be mentioned</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Scissor type of brush holder, used for slip rings, and consisting
of two arms pivoted together like a pair of scissors. The lower ends
of the arms carry the brushes, suitably mounted, and the upper ends
are drawn together by a spring, which thus exerts pressure on the brushes.</p>

<p>2. Clock spring type of brush holder in which the necessary contact
pressure is applied to the brush by means of a clock spring, which, with
the aid of a ratchet may be wound up and adjusted to any desired pressure.</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 347.&mdash;Western Electric brush holder. This holder consists of a rugged iron casting,
elliptical in section, and supported from the commutator end bearing bracket in such a
manner as to provide for the shifting of the brushes. A handle attached to the yoke aids
in this shifting and a thumb nut on the outside holds the whole brush gear in the desired
position. The brush is fed through an accurately broached slot by a spring which maintains
uniform pressure against the commutator throughout the wearing length of the
brush. The long lever arm of the spring is sufficiently flexible to take up any minor vibrations
of the brush. The tension of the brush may be adjusted without lifting it from the
commutator or disturbing any of the other holders. The brush, may be removed for
inspection by throwing the spring out of notch. The brush is connected to the holder by
flexible copper pig tails of ample current carrying capacity.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How are brush holders carried?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are carried by a <i>rocker arm</i> for bipolar, and by a
<i>rocker ring</i> for multipolar machines, which is mounted upon one
of the main bearings, or upon a support specially provided for
it, being pivoted to revolve from the same center as the shaft,
to permit shifting the brushes.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Mention one trouble sometimes encountered
with brush holders.</b></p>

<p>Ans. There is sometimes trouble resulting from the current
passing through the spring which heats it and destroys its
elasticity.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 348.&mdash;Western Electric parallel spring brush holder as used on the larger machines.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How may this be avoided?</b></p>

<p>Ans. By insulating one end of the spring, and carrying the
entire current directly from the brush itself to the main conductors
by a flexible copper strip or cable firmly connected to both.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to brush construction
on machines for electrolytic work?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The collection of large currents at low voltage, generated
by comparatively small machines, requires careful design of
brushes and brush holders. The commutator is longer than the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
commutators on machines of equal capacity at higher voltages,
and as a rule the commutator segments are thicker and fewer in
number. Each brush set is made up of numerous narrow brushes
rather than two abnormally wide ones.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An example of brush and brush gear designed to meet such conditions
is shown in <a href="#FIG_328">fig. 328</a>.</p>

<p>In large machines for electrolytic work, it is not unusual to find
the current divided between two wide commutators, one at each end
of the armature, thus giving a longer axial bearing surface for the brushes
without inconveniently lengthening the pins upon which the separate
brushes are threaded.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Multipolar Brush Gear.</b>&mdash;The brush gear which includes
the holders and carrier arm or ring, becomes more complicated as
the number of poles and magnitude of the current is increased.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the early days of multipolar machines, schemes of armature winding
were devised such that all the necessary cross connections were made
inside the machine, and the number of brush holders reduced to two
and placed at an angular distance apart depending upon the number
of poles. Such windings, though possible, are not used much, chiefly
on account of their complexity, which not only increases the danger of
error in construction, but also makes repairs costly. In modern multipolar
machines, such complicated windings are avoided, and the several
sets of brushes are connected together in two groups, positive and
negative. These connections are carefully designed as part of the brush
gear.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How are the brushes held in large multipolar
dynamos?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are held at the proper points of commutation by
arms offset from a cast iron rocker ring, which is itself supported
by brackets projecting from the magnet yoke as shown in <a href="#FIG_346">fig. 346</a>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What provision is made for shifting the ring to
adjust the lead?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The ring is rotated by means of a worm gear and
hand wheel.</p>

<h2 id="ARMATURE_CONSTRUCTION"><small>CHAPTER XXII</small><br />

ARMATURE CONSTRUCTION</h2>


<p>The armature of a dynamo has been defined as: <i>a collection
of coils of wire wound around an iron core, and so arranged that
electric currents are induced in the wire when the armature is
rotated in a magnetic field</i>.</p>

<p>From the mechanical point of view the armature may be said
to be made up of the following parts:</p>

<p>
1. Shaft;<br />
2. Core;<br />
3. Spider<br />
<span class="i8">(in large machines);</span><br />
4. Winding;<br />
5. Commutator<br />
<span class="i8">(broadly speaking).</span><br />
</p>

<p>Of the two types of armature, ring and drum, the latter is
almost universally used, hence the examples of construction
which follow will be confined chiefly to this type.</p>

<p><b>Shaft.</b>&mdash;A typical armature shaft is shown in <a href="#FIG_349">fig. 349</a>. It is
made of steel and, except in the smaller machines, is thicker
in the middle than at the ends for stiffness to withstand the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
strong magnetic side pull on the core when the latter is
slightly, nearer one pole piece than the other.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the object of providing shoulders on the
shaft as in <a href="#FIG_349">fig. 349</a>?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They serve to keep the armature in the proper position
with respect to the bearings.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How is the shaft proportioned?</b></p>

<p>Ans. If it be proportioned to secure the proper stiffness, it
will be found of ample size to resist the twisting strain.</p>

<div id="FIG_349" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig349.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 349.&mdash;Typical shaft for an armature. The illustration shows the keyways for pulley
armature and commutator. In the smaller sizes, there is usually a flange at A, and
threads at B and C for retaining nuts.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The shaft is subject also to bending by the weight of the armature,
by the magnetic drag on its core, and in belt driven machines, by the
lateral drag of the pulley. When running, it is also subjected to bending
stresses if the armature be not properly balanced. If the bearings do not
give, it is evident that all such actions tend to bend the shaft at definite
points.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Core.</b>&mdash;In the small and medium size dynamos, the core
is attached direct to the shaft. There are two kinds of core:</p>

<p>
1. Smooth;<br />
2. Slotted.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said of the smooth type of core?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It has become obsolete, except in special cases, as for
machines used for electrolytic work where a large current at low
voltage is required.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is necessary with a smooth core?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Driving horns as later described.</p>

<div id="FIG_350" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig350.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 350.&mdash;Laminated smooth core armature partly assembled. It consists of numerous
discs of thin sheet iron threaded on the shaft and pressed together by end plates. The
object of this construction is to prevent eddy currents.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is a slotted core?</b></p>

<p>Ans. One having a series of parallel slots, similar to the
spaces between the teeth of a gear wheel, and in which the
inductors are laid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What provision is made to avoid eddy current
in cores?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are laminated.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe this method of construction.</b></p>

<p>Ans. The core is made of stampings of thin wrought iron or
mild steel. The numerous discs stamped from the sheet metal
are threaded on the shaft as in <a href="#FIG_350">fig. 350</a>, forming a practically
solid metal mass.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 351.&mdash;Sectional view of laminated smooth core armature showing end plates, flange
and retaining nut. A key is provided to prevent rotation of the core with respect to the
shaft.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How thick are the discs?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The thickness ranges from .014 inch to .025 inch, corresponding
to 27 and 22 B and S gauge respectively, 27 gauge
being mostly used.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How are the discs held in place?</b></p>

<p>Ans. By two end plates pressed together either by large
nuts screwed directly on the shaft as in <a href="#FIG_351">fig. 351</a>, or by bolts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
passing through the core from end to end, as in <a href="#FIG_352">fig. 352</a>, holes
being punched in the discs for the purpose.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What precaution is taken with respect to the
core bolts?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are insulated from the core by tubes and washers
of mica or other insulating material.</p>

<div id="FIG_352" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig352.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 352.&mdash;Laminated armature core with through retaining bolts. In the larger sizes, these
bolts are used instead of a nut threaded on the shaft on account of the large size of the
latter.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the construction of the core end plates,
and why?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The rims are beveled quite thin to avoid eddy currents.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How is the core connected to the shaft?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Since the core has the full torque exerted upon it by
the drag of the inductors, it must be firmly connected to the
shaft by means of a key, as shown, so that it may be positively
driven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Core discs are stamped in one piece up to about 30 inches in diameter,
and for larger sizes they are built up from sections as later described.</p>

<p>Figs. 353 and 354 show two forms of disc stamped in one piece. The
first illustrates a solid disc, and the second a <i>ventilated</i> disc in which
more or less of the metal is cut away near the center, thus providing
passages for the circulation of air which carries away some of the heat
generated in the armature.</p></blockquote>

<div id="FIG_353" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig353-354.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 353 and 354.&mdash;Solid and ventilated core discs. In fig. 353, the metal cut away near
the center reduces the weight and provides passages for air circulation. In some instances
a forced circulation is secured by means of a fan attached to the armature, as shown in
<a href="#FIG_366">fig. 366</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Insulation of Core Discs.</b>&mdash;When the discs are stamped
from very thin metal, the mere existence of a film of oxide is
sufficient insulation. It is usual, however, to apply a quick
drying varnish that will give a hard tough coat and not soften
with heat or become brittle and crumble under vibration. The
varnish may be applied either by dipping or with a japanning
machine; it must be very thin, and the solvent employed should
be a very volatile spirit.</p>

<p><b>Forms of Armature Teeth.</b>&mdash;The teeth stamped in the core
discs are made in various shapes, depending largely on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
method of securing the inductors in the slots against electromagnetic
drag and centrifugal force. The teeth may be cut
with their sides:</p>

<p>
1. Inclined;<br />
2. Projecting;<br />
3. Notched.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said of teeth with inclined sides?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A tooth of this type is shown in <a href="#FIG_356">fig. 356</a>, being slightly
narrower at the root than at the top, the resulting slot having
parallel sides.</p>

<div id="FIG_355" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig355.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 355.&mdash;Western Electric slotted armature core. The laminations are of sheet steel, annealed
and japanned. They are mounted directly on the shaft, (except in the large sizes)
and held in place by substantial end plates.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What are the features of the projecting type of
tooth?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The projecting type is shown in figs. 357 and 358 in which
the tops project; this gives a larger core area around the circumference
of the armature which reduces the reluctance of the
air gap, and provides projecting surfaces for retaining the
inductors in the slots by the insertion of wedges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the object of cutting notches in teeth?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are provided for the insertion of retaining wedges,
as in <a href="#FIG_360">fig. 361</a>; this results in less area at the top of the teeth.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How should teeth be proportioned to secure most
efficient operation?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The width of the tooth should be about equal to the
width of the slot minus twice the thickness of the slot insulation;
that is, the cross sectional area of the teeth should be equal to
that of the slots.</p>

retaining wedges; fig. 359 enclosed type which forms "tunnels" for the inductors.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Advantages and Defects of Slotted Armatures.</b>&mdash;The
slotted armature, sometimes called the Pacinotti armature, after
its inventor, has the following advantages over the smooth type:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span></p>

<p class="hang">1. The inductors are held more firmly in place to resist stresses
due to electromagnetic drag and centrifugal force;</p>

<p class="hang">2. The inductors are protected by the teeth against mechanical
injury;</p>

<p class="hang">3. Less reluctance of the air gap;</p>

<p class="hang">4. The intermittent induction due to the presence of the teeth
prevents the formation of eddy currents.</p>

<p class="hang">5. When the teeth are saturated they oppose the shifting of
the lines due to armature reaction.</p>

<div id="FIG_360" class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 360 and 361.&mdash;Projecting and notched teeth; cross sections showing inductors and
retaining wedges in place.</p>
</div>

<p>The disadvantages of slotted armatures compared with the
smooth type are:</p>

<p class="hang">1. Greater hysteresis loss, caused by denser flux in the teeth;</p>

<p class="hang">2. Generation of eddy currents in the polar faces when the
latter are not of laminated construction;</p>

<p class="hang">3. Greater self-induction in the armature coils;</p>

<p class="hang">4. Construction more expensive;</p>

<p class="hang">5. Leakage of magnetic lines through core, exterior to winding.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The generation of eddy currents in the polar faces may be overcome
by making the air gap at least 50 per cent. of the distance between the
teeth, so that the magnetic lines can spread from the corners of the teeth,
and become nearly uniformly distributed over the polar faces. Magnetic
leakage through the core may be reduced by making the amount of
metal above the inductors very small.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p><b>Slotted Cores; Built Up Construction.</b>&mdash;In the case of
large dynamos, the core discs are built up in order to reduce the
cost of construction; the following parts are used:</p>

<p>
1. Spider;<br />
2. Core rings split into sections.<br />
</p>

The layers of ring sections are placed so as to break joints and are held by end clamps
and through bolts B. Distance pieces are inserted at intervals to provide ventilating
spaces D, D, D.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the approved method of core construction
in large armatures?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The core should be of the built up construction to avoid
waste of material in the stampings.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the construction of a built up core.</b></p>

<p>Ans. Ring sections stamped, from sheet metal are fastened
to a central support or <i>spider</i>, which consists of an iron hub

with radiating spokes and a rim with provision for fastening
the rings. The rim of the spider is provided with dovetail
notches into which fit similarly shaped internal projections on the
core segments. These features are shown in figs. 362 to 364.
Each layer of core sections is placed on the spider so as to break
joints and the core thus formed is firmly held in place by end
clamps as shown. The manner of fastening the rings to the
spider is an important point, for it must be done without reducing
the effective cross section of the core in order not to choke the
magnetic flux.</p>

<p>In order to secure a better fit and reduce the machine work, the
spider hub in large machines is sometimes cored with enlarged section
between the outer bearing surfaces, and it is not unusual to find these
surfaces turned to two different sizes as in <a href="#FIG_365">fig. 365</a>, to admit of easier
erecting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>

<p>To avoid any trouble that may arise by unequal expansion, the rim
of the spider is not made continuous, but in several sections as shown
in <a href="#FIG_364">fig. 364</a>. The rim here consists of four sections each of which has two
dovetail notches. By thus dividing the rim into sections, its weight
is somewhat reduced and the ventilating spaces between the sections
increased.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ventilation.</b>&mdash;In the operation of a dynamo more or less
heat is generated, depending on the load; hence it is desirable
that provision be made to carry off some of this heat to prevent
excessive rise of temperature.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. Why do armature cores heat?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They heat from these causes: eddy currents, hysteresis,
and heat generated in the inductors.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How is adequate ventilation secured?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The spider is constructed with as much open space as
possible through which air currents may circulate. The core
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
is divided into several sections
with intervening air spaces D as
shown in <a href="#FIG_362">fig. 363</a>, the discs being
kept apart at these points by distance
pieces. These openings
between the discs are called <i>ventilating
ducts</i>; they are usually
spaced from 2 to 4 inches apart.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What other provision

secure ventilation?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In some machines a
forced circulation of air is secured
by means of a fan attached
to one end of the armature as
shown in <a href="#FIG_366">fig. 366</a>.</p>

<p><b>Insulation of Core.</b>&mdash;Before
the winding is assembled on the
core, the latter should be thoroughly
insulated. Japan or enamel
insulation is not sufficient
because it is liable to have bubbles
or minute holes in it, or be
pierced by particles of metal
or by the rough edges of the core
discs. Two or more layers of
strong paper, fibre, canvas or
mica, should be applied to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
core before placing the inductors in position. The ends of the
core should be insulated with thicker material, since the strain
upon it is greater, especially at the edges.</p>

discs are held by end plates, clamped without through bolts. The coils are machine formed
of round ribbon or bar copper depending on the size and purpose of the machine, being
without joint except at the commutator. They lie in insulated troughs, the upper layers
being insulated from the lower layers by fibre.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Armature Windings.</b>&mdash;The subject of windings has been
fully treated from the theoretical point of view in chapter XVIII.
It remains then to explain the different methods employed in the
shop and the mechanical devices used to construct the scheme of
winding adopted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the construction of the inductors?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are made of copper; the ordinary form consists
of simple copper wire, insulated with a double or triple covering
of cotton, and in some cases copper bars are used for large current
machines.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the objection to copper bars?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are liable to have eddy currents set up in them
as illustrated in <a href="#FIG_291">fig. 291</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 368.&mdash;Holzer Cabot iron clad band wound armature complete; view showing openings

coil may be replaced in case of injury and the additional cooling surface. The coils are
held in place by maple wedges secured by binding wires which are soldered throughout
their length.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to the sizes of
wire used for inductors?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Wire larger than about number 8 B and S gauge (.1285
inch diameter) is not easily handled, hence for large inductors,
two or more wires may be wound together in parallel.</p>

<p>According to the mechanical features and manner of assembling
on the core, drum windings may be divided into several
classes, as follows:</p>

<p>
1. Hand winding;<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>2. Evolute or butterfly winding;<br />
3. Barrel winding;<br />
4. Bastard winding;<br />
5. <b>Former</b> winding.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Hand Winding.</b>&mdash;The first windings were put on by hand
and proved objectionable on account of the clumsy overlapping
of the wires at the ends of the armature, which stops ventilation
and hinders repairs, while the outer layers overlying those first
wound, bring into close proximity inductors of widely varying
voltage. The method is still used in special cases and for small
machines. Such a winding has rarely, if ever, been made with
one continuous wire.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 369 and 370.&mdash;Evolute and "straight out" connectors. In small machines the connectors
must be curved as in fig. 369, but in large machines, especially where the teeth are wide,
they may be straight as in fig. 370. These connectors may take either of the following
forms: 1. <i>involute or evolute connectors</i>&mdash;An involute is the curve drawn by the extremity
of a piece of string which is unwound from a cylinder; 2. <i>spiral connectors</i>&mdash;These consist of
double spirals, the commutator being usually connected to the junction of the two spirals.
These connectors are also known as "butterfly" connectors.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span></p>

<p><b>Evolute or Butterfly Winding.</b>&mdash;This mode of winding,
was introduced by Siemens for electroplating dynamos to overcome
the objections to hand winding. It takes its name from
the method of uniting the inductors by means of spiral end
connectors as shown in <a href="#FIG_374">fig. 374</a>, also in figs. 369 and 370, which
show more modern forms.</p>

to gauge. The commutator segments are of drop forged copper in the smaller and hard-drawn
copper in the larger sizes. The insulating material between the segments is mica.
On the larger sizes, the commutator shell is fitted with a thread and mounted on a spider.
This construction provides openings between the commutator and shaft for ventilation.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What are evolute connectors?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The fork shaped strips used to connect bars at different
positions on the armature, as shown in <a href="#FIG_369">fig. 369</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In large machines, especially where the teeth are wide, these connections
may be straight, but in small cc machines they must be curved in
the manner shown in the upper part of the figure, as the room available
may diminish by as much as half, as the lowest point is reached, and the
room occupied by the strip is the width of a horizontal section at various
points. This width, in the case of the straight connections, is constant.</p>

<p>In place of the wooden block, used in early machines, for fastening
the middle part of the connectors, they may be anchored to an insulated
clamping device built up like a commutator and for that reason
called a <i>false commutator</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 372 and 373.&mdash;<i>Barrel</i> and <i>evolute</i> windings; end views showing placement of coils.
When all the coils are wound on the former, the placing of them on the armature is a simple
matter. After insulating the slots, the winder begins at any convenient slot, and inserts
the coils as shown. Before he can fill all the slots, some of the first coils must be raised and
the last ones inserted underneath. There is not much difference between barrel and
evolute winding and one style may be used at one end of the armature and the other at the
<b>opposite end</b>.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How are the inductors arranged in evolute
winding?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In <a href="#FIG_372">fig. 373</a>, it will be seen that the ends of the evolute
connectors lie in two planes, hence the inductors must project
to different distances beyond the core. Accordingly, one long
and one short bar may be conveniently placed in each slot, side
by side. In large machines, especially where the teeth are wide,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
the connectors may be straight as in <a href="#FIG_369">fig, 370</a>. Evolute connectors
may be used for either lap or wave windings.</p>

Their outer ends are attached to the bars by rivets or silver solder.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Barrel Winding.</b>&mdash;This is a form of drum winding <i>in which
the inductors are arranged in two layers and carried out obliquely

lie on a cylindrical surface, which is a continuation of the armature surface. The coil
<i>ends</i> must of necessity be arranged in two layers, but the method may be used for either one
or two coils per slot, the difference in arrangement for these is here illustrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

<p>Barrel winding has been very widely adopted. Although it involves
an increased length of armature, this gives additional cooling surface and
provides for good ventilation.</p>

<p>In barrel winding, the coil ends must of necessity be arranged in two
layers but the method may be used for either one or two coils per slot,
the difference in arrangement for these two cases being shown in figs.
375 and 376. In the single layer barrel winding, <a href="#FIG_375">fig. 375</a>, each slot is
occupied by but one side of one coil. In the double layer barrel winding,
<a href="#FIG_375">fig. 376</a>, the opposite sides of two separate coils occupy space in the same
slot. The coils, on emerging from the slots bend in opposite directions,
and if one side of a coil occupy the bottom portion of a slot, its other
side usually occupies the top portion of a slot distant from the first slot
by the polar pitch.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p><b>Bastard Winding.</b>&mdash;In this type of winding, the end connectors
project from the inductors in straight lines parallel
to the shaft and then are bent inward. It has the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
effect of being somewhat shorter than the barrel winding. In
order to secure better ventilation, it is usual to combine a
bastard winding at the rear end of the armature with a barrel

<p><b>Former Winding.</b>&mdash;This relates to a method of winding
coils, and not to any particular type; that is, mechanical winding

<p><b>Ques. What is a "former" coil?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A former coil, as its name suggests, is one that is wound
complete upon a former before being placed upon the armature.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the advantage of this method of winding
coils?</b></p>

<p>Ans. By the use of formers much time is saved, thus reducing
the cost, and also by their use all the coils are symmetrical which
improves the appearance of the finished winding.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. How is the required shape of the template or
former for winding the coils determined?</b></p>

<p>Ans. By winding one coil on the armature in order to ascertain
its dimensions and shape; it is then removed from the
armature and used as a pattern in constructing the former.</p>

<p><b>Types of Former Coil.</b>&mdash;Of the numerous shapes of former
coil, mention should be made of:</p>

<p>
1. Evolute coils;<br />
2. Straight out coils.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the evolute type of former coil.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<p>Ans. The evolute coil is wound around eight pins inserted in
a board as shown in <a href="#FIG_381">fig. 381</a>. The required number of turns are
taken around these pins and their ends G and H left projecting.
The coil thus formed is now covered with tape and after removal
from the board, is put into a clamp at C and F, and
opened up as shown in <a href="#FIG_382">fig. 382</a>, which is the form required for
insertion in the proper slots of the armature.</p>

<div id="FIG_381" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig381-382.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 381.&mdash;Method of winding evolute coils. In preparing the former, it is necessary to know
the dimensions of the coil, hence, a pattern coil must first be made, from which the spacing
of the pins can be taken so that the completed coil will fit into the slots for which it is
intended. After the pins have been properly spaced on the board, the wire is wound
around them as indicated, as many turns being taken as decided on for each coil. When
the coil is thus completely wound, it is taken from the pins, and the lower ends, C and F,
placed in a suitable clamp. The two halves of the coil are then spread apart, the coil
assuming the shape illustrated in <a href="#FIG_382">fig. 382.</a></p>

correspond to similar points in <a href="#FIG_381">fig. 381</a>.</p></div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the peculiarity of the evolute coil?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The two sides of the evolute coil have unequal dimensions.
The part marked AB, in <a href="#FIG_381">fig. 381</a> which is an upper
layer inductor is longer than the part DE, which constitutes a
lower layer inductor. The portions DC and EF act as parts
of an inner layer of evolutes, and the portions AF and BC as
parts of an outer layer of evolutes. These features are shown
in <a href="#FIG_382">fig. 382</a>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How are evolute coils placed on the core?</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>Ans. They are placed in position as shown in figs. 372 and
373, continuing around the core until all the slots are filled. To
complete the operation it is necessary to raise some of the first
laid coils and insert the last ones below them. The winding
is thus completed and is symmetrical.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the method of winding the "straight
out" type of former coil.</b></p>

<p>Ans. The straight out coil may be wound on a former such
as shown in <a href="#FIG_384">fig. 384</a>. This consists of a board having four
upright pins, A, B, D, E, properly spaced and two horizontal

<p><b>Coil Retaining Devices.</b>&mdash;In the operation of a dynamo

MOTORS</h2>


<p>An electric motor is just the reverse of a dynamo; it is <i>a
machine for converting electrical energy into mechanical energy</i>.</p>

<p>The electrical energy delivered by the dynamo must be
obtained from a steam engine, gas engine, or other power;
the mechanical energy obtained from the motor comes from the
energy of the current flowing through its armature.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the construction of a motor?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is constructed in the same manner as a dynamo.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Any machine that can be used as a dynamo will, when supplied with
electrical power, run as a motor, and conversely, a motor when driven
by mechanical power, will supply electrical energy to the circuit connected
to it. Dynamos and motors, therefore, are convertible machines,
and the differences that are found in practice are largely mechanical;
they arise chiefly from the conditions under which the motor must work.
Hence, the study of the motor begins with a knowledge of the dynamo,
and accordingly the student should understand thoroughly all the
fundamental principles of the dynamo, as already given, before proceeding
further with the study of the motor.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Principles of the Motor.</b>&mdash;All the early attempts to introduce
motors failed, chiefly because the law of the conservation
of energy was not fully recognized. This law states that <i>energy

<p>Early experimenters discovered, by placing a galvanometer
in a circuit with a motor and battery, that, <i>when the motor was
running, the battery was unable to force through the wires so strong
a current as that which flowed when the motor was standing still</i>.
Moreover, the faster the motor ran, the weaker did the current
become.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. Why does less current flow when the motor is
running than when standing still?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Because the motor, on account of its rotation acts as a
dynamo and thus tends to set up in the circuit a <i>reverse electromotive
force</i>, that is, an electromotive force in opposite direction
to the current which is driving the motor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the real driving force which causes the
armature of a motor to rotate?</b></p>

<p>Ans. <i>The propelling drag</i>, that is, the drag which the magnetic
field exerts upon the armature wires through which the current
is flowing, or in the case of deeply toothed cores, upon the protruding
teeth.</p>

<p><b>The Propelling Drag.</b>&mdash;In <a href="#FIG_389">fig. 389</a> is shown the condition
which prevails when a conductor carrying no current is placed
in a uniform magnetic field. The magnetic lines pass straight
from one pole to the other. The field is not distorted whether
the conductor be at rest or in motion, so long as there is no
flow of current. This represents the condition in the air gap
of a motor or dynamo, when no current is flowing in the armature.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What happens when a current flows in the
conductor of <a href="#FIG_389">fig. 389</a>.</b></p>

<p>Ans. It sets up a magnetic field of its own as shown in fig.
390.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of this magnetic field?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It distorts the original field (<a href="#FIG_389">fig. 389</a>) in which the
conductor lies, making the magnetic lines denser on one side
and less dense on the other as in <a href="#FIG_390">fig. 390</a>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the nature of these distorted magnetic
lines?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They tend to shorten themselves to their original form
of straight lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What effect has this on the conductor?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It produces a force on the conductor tending to push
it in the direction indicated by the arrow, <a href="#FIG_390">fig. 390</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 390.&mdash;Conductor carrying a current in a magnetic field. The current flowing in the
conductor sets up a magnetic field which distorts the original field as shown, making
the magnetic lines denser on one side and less dense on the other. This results in a force
upon the wire, which, in the case of a dynamo (<a href="#FIG_391">fig. 391</a>) opposes its movement, and
which forms the <i>propelling drag</i> in the case of a motor (<a href="#FIG_391">fig. 392</a>).</p>

<p>According to Lenz' law, the direction of the current in the armature
of a dynamo is such as to oppose the motion producing it. When the
armature of a dynamo is rotated, the bending of the lines of force of
the main magnetic field due to armature reaction acts as a drag against
the motion of the armature. Armature reaction increases with the
increase of the armature current. Therefore, the effect of the drag
increases with the increase of load and requires an additional expenditure
of power to drive the armature.</p>

<p>In a motor, the direction of the actuating current is the reverse of
that of the armature current of a dynamo, consequently, the armature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
reaction which constitutes a drag, acting against rotation of the armature of
a dynamo, becomes a pull in the direction of rotation of the armature of
a motor and constitutes its real turning effect or <i>torque</i> which is used
at the pulley to do mechanical work. The greater the load applied
to the motor, the greater will be the amount of current taken from the
supply mains, and consequently, the greater the <i>torque</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 394.&mdash;Showing relative directions of armature current and reverse electromotive force of a
motor. When a motor is in operation, the wires around the periphery of its armature
"cut" the magnetic lines of force produced by the field magnet exactly as in the case of
the dynamo. Consequently, an electromotive force is induced in each wire, as in the
dynamo armature. This induced electromotive force is in opposition to the flow of current
due to the electromotive force of the supply circuit, and tends, therefore, to keep
down the flow of current. The figure shows a single loop of wire, on the armature core
connected directly to the source of electricity. With current flowing in the loop in the
direction indicated by the arrows marked <i>c</i>, a magnetic field is set up in the direction
indicated by the large arrow marked "direction of armature flux." With the field magnet
energized so as to produce a field in the direction indicated by the large arrow F, the
reaction between the two fields will turn the armature core in the direction indicated by
the arrow R. As the core turns, the upper wire of the loop will cut the flux under the south
pole of the field magnet, and the other side of the loop will cut the flux under the north
pole. The result will be the induction of a reverse electromotive force in the loop, the
direction being indicated by the small arrows marked <i>e</i>. The actual flow of current in the
armature is that due to the difference between the impressed and reverse voltage;
the latter is proportional to the speed of the armature, the number of armature
wires and the strength of the magnetic field in the air gaps between the armature and
the pole faces. The speed of a motor supplied with current at constant voltage varies
directly with the reverse electromotive force, also with other conditions fixed, the
stronger the field, the slower the speed. Weakening the field will increase the speed up
to the point where the increase in reverse electromotive force due to the increased speed
cuts down the armature current below the value necessary to give the requisite pull at the
armature periphery. When this point is reached, any weakening of the field will reduce
the speed of the armature. The pull or <i>torque</i> of a motor armature is directly proportional
to the strength of the magnetic field, and to the strength of the armature current,
the number of armature inductors being fixed. In a field of constant strength, therefore,
the pull of the armature depends on the amount of current passing through the winding.
The torque must be just sufficient to overcome the load; if in excess, the speed will
increase until the increase of the reverse electromotive force reduces the current and the
increase of speed increases the load to the point of equilibrium between load and torque.
If the torque be insufficient for the load, the speed will diminish until equilibrium is
established, assuming the motor is running on constant voltage circuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe similar conditions which prevail in the
operation of a dynamo.</b></p>

<p>Ans. When no current is being generated by the dynamo,
little power is required to drive it, but when the external circuit
is closed and current is forced through it against more or less
resistance, work is being done, hence more power is required.
In other words, there is an opposition to the mechanical force
applied at the pulley which is proportional to the electric power
delivered by the dynamo. An opposing reaction or <i>reverse force</i>
then is set up in a dynamo when it does work.</p>

or <i>against</i> it. In the figure, the generator and motor are rotating clockwise, and hence
each generates an electromotive force tending upwards from the lower brush to the higher.
In each case the upper brush is the positive one. In the dynamo, where energy is

<p><b>Ques. Explain the action of the current supplied to a
motor for its operation.</b></p>

<p>Ans. The motor current passing through the field magnets
polarizes them and establishes a magnetic field, and entering
the armature, polarizes its core in such a way that the positive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
pole of the core is away from the negative pole of the magnetic
field, and the negative pole is away from the positive pole of
the magnetic field. The magnetic repulsions and attractions
thus created cause the armature to rotate in a position of magnetic
equilibrium or so as to bring its positive and negative poles
opposite the negative and positive poles respectively of the
magnetic field. It is evident that unless suitable means were
provided to reverse the polarity of the armature core at the
instant it reached the position of the magnetic equilibrium, the
armature would not rotate any further. The construction is such
that the polarity of the armature core, or the direction of the
current in the armature coils is reversed at the proper instant
automatically by the commutator, thus giving continuous
rotation.</p>

edge</i> and decrease the intensity at the <i>trailing polar edge</i>. In a dynamo, the armature
has to be moved by mechanical force, against a magnetic force, hence the leading polar
edge is weakened, while the trailing edge is strengthened. The magnetomotive force
in a motor armature is, therefore, opposed to the direction of that in a generator armature,
when the direction of rotation and the direction of the field magnetomotive force are
the same. Upon this depends all the relations existing between the direction of rotation

<p>Ans. Because if the connections be such that the current
supplied will flow through the armature in the same direction

the field will be reversed, since the field windings are in parallel

current is flowing through it from the top brush, while it is itself the seat of an electromotive
force that tends to stop or reverse its current. The condition for sparkless commutation
requires that during the interval the coil is short circuited by the brush, the
coil should be passing through a field that is not only sufficiently strong but one that
tends to reverse the direction of its current. The coil is already in such a field, hence,
commutation must take place <i>before</i> it passes put of this field. To accomplish this the
brushes must be shifted backward, that is, given <i>negative lead</i>, to overcome sparking.
In other words, the <i>commutating plane</i> must be shifted <i>back</i> of the neutral plane in a

<p><b>Ques. What are the conditions of minimum sparking?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The same conditions must obtain as in a dynamo,
that is, the current in the coil undergoing commutation must be
brought to rest and started again in the opposite direction.
This involves that while the coil is short circuited by the brush,
it should be passing through a field that tends to reverse the
direction of the current. Since the coil is already in such a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>

out of this field. Accordingly, a negative lead must be given
the brushes.</p>

<p><b>Method of Starting a Motor.</b>&mdash;Although motors and dynamos
are practically similar in general construction and either
one of them will act as the other when suitably traversed by
an electric current, there are certain differences between the
connections and accessories of a machine operated as generator
and one employed as a motor. For instance, when a machine
is operated as a dynamo, it is first driven up to speed until it
has excited itself to the right pressure, and then it is connected
to the circuit; but when a machine is used as a motor it will
not start until it has been connected to the circuit, and this
must not be done until the proper precautions have been taken
to ensure that the current, which will pass through it when so
connected, will not be excessive and thereby result in serious
injury to the motor. For this reason a rheostat or variable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
resistance, commonly called a starting box is usually inserted
in the armature circuit of a motor to prevent an undue rush
of current before the motor attains its speed, and subsequently
the speed is regulated by the cutting in or out of the circuit
of certain extra resistances which constitute the controller used
on a series motor requiring variable torque at variable speed, as
in the case of elevator or electric traction service.</p>

<div id="FIG_415" class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 415.&mdash;View of railway motor, open. The frame is of cast steel for lightness, and which
serves as magnetic circuit and protecting case. It is circular or octagonal in form except
in very large motors. Four short magnets project from the case. The armature is
large in order to secure the required torque. It is always series wound, requiring two
brushes. The brush holders are mounted upon a frame of insulating material which is
attached to the upper half of the case. The brushes are adjustable radially, but usually
it is not necessary to provide for shifting as they remain in the neutral plane. In motors
which receive so little attention as these, special attention must be given to the design
of devices for keeping oil and grease out of the case. These would injure the insulation
of the coils and produce sparking at the commutator. Oil rings are, therefore, placed
on the shaft, and these discharge into chambers connected to the oil wells or allow the oil
to overflow on the track. The bearings are made self-oiling or self-greasing by means of
rings or wicks and will run for weeks without attention.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

<p><b>Classes of Motor.</b>&mdash;Motors are classified in the same manner
as dynamos. The fields may be either bipolar or multipolar,
and with respect to the type of armature winding employed,
motors are classed as:</p>

<p>
1. Series wound;<br />
2. Shunt wound;<br />
3. Compound wound.<br />

have a constant field strength, and does not run at uniform speed. If the load be taken
off it will run at excessive speed. To start the motor, the circuit is completed through
a variable resistance or rheostat by moving the switch S so that the resistances R, R<sub>1</sub>,
R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, are gradually cut out of the circuit. To stop, the switch S is moved back to its
"off" position.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Series Motors.</b>&mdash;A series motor is one in which the field
magnet coils, consisting of a few turns of thick wire, are connected
in series with the armature so that the whole current
supplied to the motor passes through the field coils as well as
the armature. <a href="#FIG_416">Fig. 416</a> is a diagram of a series motor showing
the connections and rheostat.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the characteristics of a series motor?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The field strength increases with the current, since the
latter flows through the magnet coils. If the motor be run on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
constant voltage circuit, with light load, it will run at a very
high speed; again, if the motor be loaded heavily, the speed will
be much less than before.</p>

construction, having six pole pieces. The advantages of slow speed machinery
are generally understood, and in motors the additional outlay to secure slow speeds is
warranted, inasmuch as it results in diminished wear and friction losses in gearing, belting,
bearings, and commutators, and decreased brush renewals. The comparatively slow
speeds of these motors are of importance in that they permit belting or gearing the motors
directly to ordinary slow speed line shafting without employing intermediate counter
shafting. When motors are geared to heavy duty machines, it is considered better
practice to supply an outboard bearing to take up the additional strain that would otherwise
be put on the gearing and bearing.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. For what kinds of service are series motors
unsuited?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Series motors should not be employed where the load
may be entirely removed because they would attain a dangerous
speed. They should not be used for driving by means of belts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
because a sudden release of the load due to a mishap to the belt
would cause the motor to "run away."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Very small series motors may be used with belts since their comparatively
large frictional resistance represents an appreciable load,
restraining the motor from reaching a dangerous speed.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. For what service are series motors adapted?</b></p>

<p>Ans. For gear drive.</p>

<p>In the case of a sudden release of the load the gears provide some load

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 418.&mdash;Shunt motor connections. A shunt motor runs at constant speed on a constant
voltage circuit. In connecting the motor in circuit, the field coils must be placed in
circuit first, so that there is a certain amount of field strength to produce rotation of the
armature and thus prevent excessive current through the armature. If the field magnets
were not put in the circuit first, the armature, at rest on receiving current, would
probably burn out, because it is of low resistance, and would take practically all the
current supplied, especially since no reverse voltage is generated in the armature at rest.
The method of starting is shown in the illustration. To start, the switch is closed, and
the rheostat lever pushed over so as to make contact with A and B, thus <i>first</i> exciting
the magnets. On further movement of the lever, the rheostat resistances R, R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>,
R<sub>3</sub>, etc., are gradually cut out as the speed increases, until finally all the resistance
coils are cut out. To stop, the lever is brought back to its original position.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What advantage is obtained with series motors
with respect to the connections?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A single wire only proceeds from the rheostat to the
motor, so that, with the return wire, only two wires are required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. For what service are series motors specially
adapted?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Series motors are used principally for electric railways,
trolleys, and electric vehicles, and similar purposes where an
attendant is always at hand to regulate or control the speed.
They are also used on series arc light circuits in which the current
is of constant strength. Very small motors are generally provided
with series windings.</p>

<img src="images/fig419.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 419.&mdash;Speed regulation of a shunt motor. The speed of a motor depends on the voltage
of the current supplied and the field strength. The motor tends to rotate so fast as to
produce a <i>reverse voltage</i> nearly equal to that supplied to the brushes; hence, the speed
varies with the voltage supplied. By decreasing this voltage then, the speed is decreased.
Accordingly, the speed may be reduced by inserting, by means of a rheostat, a resistance
in series with the motor. By inserting this resistance in the field circuit, the voltage at
the terminals of the motor is lowered, thus giving the condition necessary to reduce
the speed. The arrangement for speed regulation shown in the figure includes a starting
regulator and a shunt regulator.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Shunt Motors.</b>&mdash;A shunt motor may be defined as one in
which the field coils are wound with many turns of comparatively
fine wire, connected in parallel with the brushes. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>

thus connecting C to A and B to the return wire as in fig. 421, or 2, by leaving the direction of the current in the armature in
its original direction, and reversing that of the field current, as in fig. 422. If the wires leading to the rheostat and motor
directly, were reversed there would be no reversal of the motor, because by so doing, both the armature and field magnet
currents would be reversed.</p>

current to flow in its original direction (from B to A) and reversing the current through the field coils (from C to D) as in fig. 425.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to the speed
of a shunt motor?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is practically constant with varying loads.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The variation of speed ranges from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> to 5 per cent., except in the
case of small motors, in which the variation may be much greater.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How should a shunt motor be started?</b></p>

<p>Ans. To properly start the machine, the field coils must be
fully excited.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is, therefore, necessary to switch the magnet coils immediately on
to the voltage of supply, while a variable resistance must be provided
for the armature circuit. To get both connections at the same time,
rheostats for shunt motors are arranged as shown in <a href="#FIG_418">fig. 418</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Influence of Brush Position on Speed.</b>&mdash;In the case of
a shunt motor supplied with current at constant pressure, the
speed is a minimum when the brushes are in the neutral plane,
and the effect of giving the brushes either positive or negative
lead is to increase the speed, especially with little or no load.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Why does the speed increase?</b></p>

<p>Ans. When the brushes are shifted from the neutral plane,
the reverse voltage between the brushes is decreased, speed
remaining unchanged. Accordingly, the pressure in the supply
mains forces an increased current through the armature thus
producing an increased armature pull which causes the speed
to increase until the reverse voltage reaches a value sufficiently
large to reduce the current to the value required to supply the
necessary driving torque.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span></p>

<p><b>Compound Motors.</b>&mdash;This type of motor has to a certain
extent, the merits of the series motor without its disadvantages,
and is adapted to a variety of service. If the current flow in
the same direction through both of the field windings, then the
effect of the series coil strengthens that of the shunt coil; this
strengthening is greater, the larger the armature current.</p>

<div id="FIG_426" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig426.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 426.&mdash;Compound motor connections for starting from a distant point. A compound
winding may be used on motors for many different purposes. If the current flow in the
same direction through both windings, then the effect of the series coil strengthens that of
the shunt coil. This strengthening increases with the load. Thus the motor gets, at
increasing load, a stronger magnetic field, and will therefore, if the voltage remain constant
run slower than before. Accordingly, for a given current, the starting power will be
greater than that of a shunt motor. With a decreasing load the motor will run faster.
The compound motor has, to a certain extent, the merits of the series motor without its
disadvantages. By means of compound motors the starting at a distance with only two
mains may be effected, just as in the case of the series motor. The connections are shown
in the diagram. If the motor be regarded as being without the shunt coil, then it is connected
up exactly as the series motor in <a href="#FIG_416">fig. 416</a>. The current coming from the starter
enters the series coil at F, flows through the series coil and leaves it at E, flowing from
there to the armature brush B, through the armature to brush A, and from there through
the second main back to the generator. The shunt winding is connected directly with
the armature brushes A and B, and gets at starting, therefore, only a very small voltage,
hence its field is nearly ineffective. But on account of the series winding, the motor starts
as a series motor. Obviously such a motor will not develop a very large starting power
like a real series motor, for, on account of the large space occupied by the shunt coils,
there is less space available for the series coils than with a series motor. A compound
motor may, however, even with this arrangement, be easily started, provided the load
on starting be not too heavy. When once running the armature will produce a reverse
voltage and the shunt coil will be supplied with nearly the full terminal voltage.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Mention some characteristics of the compound
motor.</b></p>

<p>Ans. Since it is a combination of the shunt and series
types, it partakes of the properties of both. The series winding
gives it strong torque at starting (though not as strong as
in the series motor), while the presence of the shunt winding
prevents excessive speed. The speed is practically constant
under all loads within the capacity of the machine.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the connections for starting a compound
motor at a distance.</b></p>

<p>Ans. Control at a distance can be effected with only two
wires, just as in the case of a series motor. In the diagram fig.
426, the current coming from the rheostat enters the series coil
at F, and leaves it at E, thence it flows to the armature brush B,
through armature to brush A, and from here back to the dynamo.
The shunt winding, which is connected across the brushes, gets
a very small voltage at starting and is accordingly very ineffective.
The motor then starts as a series motor. The starting
effect is smaller than in a series motor because of the fewer turns
in the series winding, most of the available space being occupied
by the shunt coils.</p>

<p><b>Power of a Motor.</b>&mdash;The word "power" is defined as <i>the rate

This thrust is resisted and measured <i>in pounds</i> by the scale. In setting up the brake
the distance between the center of the shaft and point of contact (knife edge) with the

<p>Ans. Tests of this kind are usually made with a Prony brake
as shown in <a href="#FIG_428">fig. 428</a>. It consists of a band of rope or strip iron&mdash;the

the contrivance from slipping off the wheel rim. The brake
band is drawn tight, as shown, so that the blocks press against

ends to form a lever which bears upon an ordinary platform
scale, a suitable leg or block being arranged to keep its end level

of friction between the brake band and the revolving wheel is
weighed upon the scales. Since the brake fits tightly enough
to be carried around by the wheel, but for the arms bearing upon

<p><b>Speed of a Motor.</b>&mdash;The normal speed at which any motor
will run is such that the sum of the reverse electromotive force
and the drop in the armature will be exactly equal to the electromotive
force applied at the brushes. The drop in the armature
is the difference between the applied voltage and the reverse
voltage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span></p>

<p><b>Mutual Relations of Motor Torque and Speed.</b>&mdash;The
character of the work to be done not only determines the condition
of the motor torque and speed required, but also the
suitability of a particular type of motor for a given service.
There are three general classes of work performed by motors, and
these require the following conditions of torque and speed:</p>

<p>1. Constant torque at variable speed;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Suitable for driving cranes, hoists, and elevators, etc., where the
load is constant and has to be moved at varying rates of speed.</p></blockquote>

<div id="FIG_429" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig429.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 429.&mdash;Two path method of speed regulation of series motor. A rheostat is connected
in shunt to the field coils as shown. The current passing from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> divides between the
magnet coils and the rheostat coils; the higher the resistance of the rheostat the less
current passes through it, and the more through the magnet coils, hence the stronger the
field magnet.</p>
</div>

<p>2. Variable torque at constant speed;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Suitable for driving line shafting in machine shops, which must
run at constant speed regardless of variations of torque due to variations
in the number of machines in operation at a time, or the
character of work being performed.</p></blockquote>

<p>3. Variable torque at variable speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Suitable for electric railway work. For example: when a car is
started, the torque is at its maximum value and the speed zero, but
as the car gains headway, the torque decreases and the speed
increases.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Speed Regulation of Motors.</b>&mdash;The speed of motors connected
to constant voltage circuits is usually regulated by the
two following methods:</p>

<div id="FIG_430" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig430.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 430.&mdash;Variable field method of speed regulation of series motor. The field winding is
divided into a number of sections with leads connecting with switch contact points as
illustrated. The speed then is regulated by cutting in or out of the circuit sections of the
field winding thus varying the strength of the field.</p>
</div>

<p class="hang">1. By inserting resistances in the armature circuit of a shunt
wound motor;</p>

<p class="hang">2. By varying the strength of the field of a series motor.</p>

<p>The first method is sufficiently explained under <a href="#FIG_418">fig. 418</a> and
the second method is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_430">fig. 430</a>. The controller
switch S is so arranged that a greater or lesser number of field
coils can be inserted in the field circuit. When the switch arm is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
on point 1, the motor current will flow through all the field
windings, and the strength of the field will be at its maximum.
When the switch arm is moved so as to successively occupy
positions 2, 3, and 4, thus cutting out of circuit a greater and
greater number of field coils the strength of the field will be
gradually decreased until practically all of the motor current
is led or wired through the armature. Under these conditions,
when the field of a motor is at its maximum strength, the motor
torque will be at a maximum for any given strength of current,
and the reverse electromotive force will also be at a maximum
for any given speed, therefore, when the field strength is increased
the speed will decrease and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What results are obtained by this method of
regulation?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The speed of a series motor may be nearly doubled,
that is, if the lowest permissible speed of the motor be 250
revolutions per minute it can be readily increased to 500 revolutions
per minute by changing the field coil connections from
series to parallel. It is on this account, as much as on their
powerful starting torque, that series motors have been until
recently almost exclusively employed for electric traction purposes.</p>

<p><b>Series Parallel Controller.</b>&mdash;When two motors are used in
electric railway work, their armatures are connected in series
with each other and an extra resistance which prevents the
passage of an excessive current through the armature before
the motor starts. As the speed of the car increases, the extra
resistance is gradually cut out of circuit and the field winding
connections changed from series to parallel by means of a series
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
parallel controller, which finally connects each motor directly
across the supply mains, or between the trolley line and the
track or ground return.</p>

<p><b>Efficiency of a Motor.</b>&mdash;The commercial efficiency of a motor
is the ratio of the output to the input. As a rule, the power
developed by a motor increases as the reverse voltage generated
by it decreases, until this voltage equals one-half of the voltage
applied at the brushes. After this point is reached, the power
developed by the motor decreases with the decrease of the
reverse voltage. Therefore, a motor performs the largest
amount of work when its reverse voltage is equal to one-half
the impressed voltage.</p>

<div id="FIG_431" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig431.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 431.&mdash;Double-throw, double-pole switch for reversing direction of rotation of a motor.
The direction of rotation can be reversed by changing the direction of current in either
the armature or the field coils. It is preferable, however, to reverse the direction of
rotation by changing the direction of current through the armature. The switch is wired
as shown, means of reversal being provided by running the wires as indicated by the
dotted lines.</p>
</div>

<p>The efficiency of a motor as just stated is the ratio of the
output to the input; this is equivalent to saying that the efficiency
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
of a motor is equal to the brake horse power divided by
the electrical horse power.</p>

<p>The electrical horse power is easily obtained by multiplying
the readings taken from volt meter and ammeter, which gives
the watts, and dividing the product by 746, the number of watts
per horse power. That is:</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 432.&mdash;Wiring diagram, showing electrical connections between the armature, field, and
interpoles of an interpole motor. As the name implies, an interpole motor has in addition
to the main poles, a series of interpoles which are placed between the main poles,
and whose function is to assist in the reversal of the current under the brushes. They
provide a separate commutating field of a correct value at all loads and speeds, and their
windings are for this purpose connected in series with the armature. The proper functioning
of the interpoles is independent of the direction of rotation of the armature, also
of the load carried over the whole speed range. In an ordinary motor without interpoles,
commutation is assisted by a magnetic fringe emanating from the main poles,
but as the value of this fringe is altered by the load of the motor and by rheostatic field
weakening, if higher speeds be desired from such a machine, commutation becomes
imperfect and sparking results, making a readjustment of the brushes necessary.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Interpole Motors.</b>&mdash;An interpole motor has in addition to
the main poles, a series of interpoles, placed between the main
poles. The object of these poles is to provide an auxiliary flux
or "commutating" field at the point where the armature coils
are short circuited by the brush.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the object of the commutating field
produced by the interpoles?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Its object is to assist commutation, that is, to help
reverse the current in each coil while short circuited by the
brush, and thus reduce sparking.</p>

<div id="FIG_438" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig438.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 438.&mdash;Interpole motor as built by the Electro Dynamic Co. This type of motor is
devised to prevent sparking at all loads by the use of interpole magnets, that is, small
magnets placed between the field magnets. The interpoles set up a field in a direction to
stop and reverse the current in the armature coils while they are short circuited by the
brushes.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the nature of the commutating field?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The excitation of the interpoles being produced by
series turns, the field will vary with the load, and will, if once
adjusted to give good commutation at any one load, keep the
same proportion for any other load, provided the iron parts of
the circuit be not too highly saturated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. State briefly how sparking is reduced or prevented
by the action of the interpoles.</b></p>

<p>Ans. Sparking is due to self-induction in the coil undergoing
commutation, which impedes the proper reversal of the current.
The action of the interpoles corrects this in that they set up a
field in a direction that causes a reversal of the current in the
coil while it is short circuited. Thus, the coil at the instant it
leaves the brush, is not an idle coil, but has a current flowing
in it in the right direction to prevent sparking.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Mention some of the claims made for interpole
motors.</b></p>

<p>Ans. Constant or adjustable speed, and momentary overloads
without sparking; constant brush position; operation at
adjustable speeds on standard supply circuits of 110, 220, and
500 volts; constant speed with variable load; reversal without
changing the position of the brushes.</p>

SELECTION AND INSTALLATION OF DYNAMOS AND MOTORS</h2>


<p><b>General Conditions Governing Selection.</b>&mdash;In any particular
case, the voltage, current capacity, and type of dynamo
selected will depend upon the system of transmission or distribution
to which it is to be connected, and the character of the
work which it is required to perform. The suitability of the
different types of dynamo for various kinds of work has already
been considered to some extent, but there are certain general
conditions which are applicable to almost all cases, such as:</p>

<p>
1. Construction;<br />
2. Operation;<br />
3. Cost;<br />
4. Number and size of units.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Construction.</b>&mdash;This should be as <i>simple</i> as possible and of
the most solid character. All parts should be interchangeable,
and have a good finish. All machines should be provided with
eye bolts or other means by which they can be lifted or moved,
as a whole or in parts, easily and without injury. These features
are so carefully attended to and guaranteed by the manufacturers
as to leave little choice in this direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span></p>

<p><b>Operation.</b>&mdash;The considerations relating to the operation of
a machine involve an examination of the details of its construction,
in order to determine the amount of attention it will require,
the character of its regulating device, its <i>capacity</i>, <i>form</i>, and
<i>weight</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said regarding capacity?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Dynamos and motors should not be overloaded, because
the efficiency is greater when the working load does not exceed
the rated capacity of the machine.</p>

<p><b>Form.</b>&mdash;As a rule, there is not much choice in the matter of
form between standard machines, as they are uniformly symmetrical,
well proportioned and compact. It is a mistake, however,
to select a light machine for stationary use, as the weight of a
machine increases its strength, stability and durability.</p>

<p><b>Cost.</b>&mdash;In some cases, the matter of first cost is important
and deserves careful consideration. It should be remembered,
however, that high grade electric machinery cannot be built out
of low grade materials and with poor workmen; therefore, when
necessity compels the selection of a cheap machine, it should not
be expected that its service will be as satisfactory as that of a
first class machine.</p>

<p><b>Number and Size of Units.</b>&mdash;The best number and size of
units for an electrical plant is usually governed by the requirements
of the driving engines. As a rule, dynamos and motors
are not much less efficient at quarter-load than at full load, and
the smaller dynamos are fully equal to the larger machines in
this respect, therefore, a generating plant can be subdivided,
and if so desired, without any detrimental results except those
to a multiplicity of units.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the important consideration with
respect to efficiency?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Efficiency at maximum load is not so important as
efficiency at average load.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For instance, in the diagram, <a href="#FIG_439">fig. 439</a>, the rated efficiency of one
dynamo as shown by the curve A, is 95 per cent., and that of another,
as shown by curve B, is 91 per cent., but it will be observed that the
average efficiency of B is much higher, being 75 per cent. at quarter-load,
89 per cent. at half-load, and 91 per cent. at three-quarter-load,
to 55, 77 and 89 per cent. of A, at the corresponding loads. In this
case, A is higher than B only at full load, and as full load is a limit
which should not be reached except in special cases, and then only for
short intervals of time, the service rendered by B would be much more
satisfactory in the long run. In order to avoid the difficulties possible
under these conditions, a guarantee to carry 25 per cent. overload for
two hours without injury should be required, and either this or the
rated load be taken, as the full load, so as to give a factor of safety of
25 per cent.</p></blockquote>

<div id="FIG_439" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig439.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 439.&mdash;Efficiency curves for 100 K. W. dynamos. The efficiency of a dynamo at maximum
load is not so important as at average load. For instance, if in the figure the curve O B C
represent the efficiency of a 100 K. W. dynamo and O A D, that of another machine, it
would be in accordance with common practice to compare them at rated load, at which
the efficiency of the first is only 91%, while the other is 93%. The first machine, however,
is far better than the second, since its average efficiency is much higher, being nearly 91%
between half-load and 25% overload. It should be noted that full load is a limit which
should be but occasionally reached, and then only for short periods of time.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Upon what does the choice of field winding of a
dynamo depend?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The different classes of field winding have already been
discussed, but in general the conditions governing selection are
as follows: The series dynamo is used where a constant current
at variable voltage is desired, as in series arc lamp circuits. A
shunt dynamo is used on constant voltage circuits, where the
distance from the machine to the load is not great, that is, where
there is small line loss. With a compound dynamo there is
compensation for line loss, that is, it can be constructed so that
the voltage at its terminals, or at the load can be maintained
constant or allowed to increase or decrease with a change in
load. It can thus operate lamps at constant voltage though
they be located at some distance, or the voltage at the end of
the line can be made to increase with an increase of load, as is
frequently the case in railway work.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 440.&mdash;Holzer Cabot performance curves of standard 20 H. P. motor, showing efficiency,
speed regulation, and amperes input.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. For what conditions of service are series motors
adapted?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are used on constant current circuits, and also on
constant voltage circuits as in railway work and similar purposes
where an attendant is always at hand to regulate the speed.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Name some advantages and disadvantages of
series motors.</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are easily started even under heavy loads, the
winding is cheaper than the other types and the speed is nearer
constant than shunt motors when operated on constant current
circuits. When used on constant pressure circuits, such as is
employed for incandescent lighting, the speed will depend on
the load.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What kind of circuit is suitable for shunt
motors?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are used on constant voltage circuits.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the advantages of shunt motors?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The speed remains nearly constant for variable load.</p>

<p><b>Ques. State the disadvantages.</b></p>

<p>Ans. They start less easily under a heavy load than do series
motors, and the speed cannot be varied through any wide range
without considerable loss. The shunt motor requires more
attention than the series type and is more liable to be burnt
out.</p>

<p><b>Location.</b>&mdash;The place chosen for the dynamo or motor should
be dry, free from dust, and preferably where a cool current of air
can be had. It should allow sufficient room for a belt of proper
length when a belt drive is used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span></p>

<p><b>Foundations.</b>&mdash;It is most important to secure a good foundation
for every dynamo, and great care should be taken to have
them entirely separate from those of the walls of the building
in which the machine is installed, and if the dynamo be directly
driven, but not on the same bed plate as the engine, a foundation
large enough for both together should be laid down. Stone
or concrete may be used, or brick built with cement, having a
large thick stone bedded at the top.</p>

<p>For small machines the holding down bolts may be set with
lead or sulphur in holes in the stone top, but for large machines
the bolts should be long enough to pass down to the bottom,
where they should be anchored with iron plates.</p>

<p><b>Setting up of Dynamos and Motors.</b>&mdash;In unpacking the
machines care should be taken to avoid injury to any part,
and in putting the parts together, each part should be carefully
cleaned, and all the parts put together in exactly the right way.
The shafts, bearings, magnetic joints, and electrical connection
should receive especial attention and be thoroughly cleaned of
every particle of dirt, grit, dust, metal clippings, etc.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Who should preferably assemble the machines?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Whenever possible, they should be assembled by someone
thoroughly familiar with the construction; but if the services
of such a person cannot be had, no one should attempt to put a
machine together unless he has a drawing or photograph of the
same for a general guide.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What precaution should be taken with the
armature?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It should be handled carefully to avoid any injury to
the wires of the winding and their insulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>If it become necessary to lay the armature on the ground it should be
laid on clean paper or cloth, but it is better to support it by the shaft on
two wooden horses or other supports, and thus avoid any strain on the
armature body or commutator.</p></blockquote>

<div id="FIG_441" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig441.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 441.&mdash;Foundation. It may be made either of concrete, stone or brick. The machinery
is held firmly in place on the foundation by anchor bolts built into it; the proper position
for the bolts are determined by a wooden template suspended above the foundation as
shown. The bolts are surrounded by iron pipe that fixes them vertically but permits a
little side play to allow for any slight errors in locating the centers on the template.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Connecting Up Dynamos.</b>&mdash;The manner in which the connections
of the field magnet coils, brushes, and terminals, are
connected to one another depends entirely upon the type of
machine. The field magnet shunt coils of shunt and compound
wound dynamos, are invariably arranged in series with one
another, and then connected as a shunt to the brushes or terminals
of the machine. The series coils of series and compound
wound machines are arranged either in series or in parallel with
one another, according to conditions of operation, and then
connected in series to the armature and external circuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span></p>

<p><b>Coupling Up Field Magnet Coils.</b>&mdash;In coupling up the
coils of either salient or consequent pole field magnets,
assume each of the pole pieces to have a certain polarity (in
bipolar dynamos two poles only, a north and south pole respectively,
are required; in multipolar dynamos the poles must be
arranged in alternate order around the armature, the number of
N and S poles being equal), then apply Flemming's rule as given
under fig. 132, to each of the coils, and ascertain the direction
in which the magnetizing current must flow in each in order to
produce the assumed polarity in each of the pole pieces. Having
marked these directions on the coils, they can be coupled up in
either series or parallel connection according to requirements, so
that the current flows in the proper direction in each.</p>

<div id="FIG_442" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig442.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 442.&mdash;Comparison of space occupied by direct and belt connected dynamos. In office
buildings space is of value and the room required by belt connected dynamos can always
be put to profitable use. For this reason the direct connected unit has become generally
adopted in the best type of office buildings. In large factories the direct connected unit
is generally adopted also to save space. Where these conditions do not obtain, belted
type of dynamo can be used to advantage as a given output can be obtained with a smaller
size machine than where it is direct connected to the engine. This is due to the limited
rotative speeds at which engines can be run. The illustration shows the relative space

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 443.&mdash;General Electric type M P, marine generating set with tandem compound engine.
The requirements of such units are compactness, light weight, simplicity, freedom from
vibration and noise at high speed, perfect regulation and durability. By adopting a short
stroke for the engines and a special armature winding for the dynamos, the height and
length of the sets have been reduced. The bed is carried out to the full width of the
dynamo frame, making an ample base surface for foundation without increasing the floor
space required. While the construction gives a massive appearance, the bed has been
cored out and the various parts so designed that the complete sets have an approximate
capacity of 3½ watts per pound. All of the moving parts are enclosed by the engine
column, excluding dust and reducing wear and attention to a minimum. The bearing are
oiled automatically under pressure. These sets are made in sizes from 25 K. W. to 75 K. W.,
the cylinder dimensions for the smallest size being 6½ and 10½ by 5, and for the largest
size 10½ and 18 by 8. Single cylinder sets are made in sizes ranging from 2½ K. W. to
50 K. W., the cylinder dimensions ranging from 3½ x 3 to 12 x 11. See fig. 730.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is a direct drive?</b></p>

<p>Ans. One in which the driving member is connected direct
to the driven member, without any interposed gearing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><a href="#FIG_443">Fig. 443</a> shows a direct connected unit, which is an example of direct
drive.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to direct drive?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is the simplest method and the space required is less
than with belt drive. With direct drive the engine and dynamo
must run at the same speed; this is a disadvantage because the
desirable speeds of the two machines may not agree.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Since the usual engine speeds are slower than dynamo speeds, direct
drive involves the use of a larger dynamo for a given output than would
be necessary with belt connection, and involves a corresponding increase
in cost and greater friction loss due to the rotation of larger and heavier
parts.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. State some of the disadvantages of belt drive.</b></p>

positive. Belts exert a side pull on the bearings which results
in wear, also loss of power by friction.</p>

be made with a punch, as indicated. The nearest hole should be ¾ inch from the side,

strong, pliable strip of leather) should be used, beginning at hole No. 1, and passing consecutively
through all the holes as numbered. In fig. 446 the holes are all made in a row.
This method has the advantage of making the lacers lie parallel with the motion on the
pulley side. The lacing is doubled to find its middle, and the two ends are passed through
the two holes marked "1" and "1<i>a</i>" precisely as in lacing a shoe. The two ends are then
passed successively through the two series of holes in the order in which they are numbered,

<p><b>Ques. What is the proper speed for a belt?</b></p>

<p>Ans. From 3,000 to 5,000 feet per minute, depending on
conditions.</p>


<h3>Points Relating to Belts.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The amount of power that a belt of given size can transmit is not
a very definite quantity. The rule just given is conservative and will
give an amply large belt for ordinary conditions.</p>

<p>2. A belt should make a straight run through the air and over the
pulleys without wabbling; it should maintain an even and perfect
contact with that part of the pulley with which it comes in contact.
In order to do this it should be kept soft, pliable, and have no abrasions
or rough places.</p></blockquote>

<div id="FIG_448" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig448.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 448.&mdash;Right way to run a belt. The pull should come on the lower side bringing the
slack on top.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>3. When belt fasteners give way there is too much strain upon belt.
The greatest amount of slack in a belt is found where it leaves the driving
pulley, hence the tightener should be near the driving pulley, as it takes
up the slack, prevents vibration and diminishes strain on belts and
bearings. More than 100 degrees of heat is injurious to belts.</p>

<p>4. Double belts should always run with the splices, and not against
them. Quarter turn belts should be made of two ply leather, so as to
diminish the side strain.</p>

<p>5. Friction is greatest when the pulleys are covered with leather.
Friction depends upon pressure, but adhesion depends upon surface
contact; the more a belt adheres to pulley surface without straining,
through too much tightening, the better the driving power. Slipping
occurs on wet days because the leather absorbs dampness.</p>

<p>6. A leather covered pulley will produce more resistance than polished
or rough iron ones. A good belt dressing makes a smooth, resisting surface,
and as it contains no oils which create a slippery surface to belts,
it increases belt adhesion. The friction of leather upon leather is five
times greater than leather upon iron.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span></p>

<p>7. Moisture and water distend the fibres, change the properties of
the tanner's grease and softening compounds. Repeated saturation and
drying will soon destroy leather. Leather well filled with tanner's grease
or animal oil, if allowed to hang in a warm room for several months
without handling, will dry out, become harsh, and will readily crack.</p>

<p>8. A running belt is stretched and relaxed at different times and
unless there be perfect elasticity in all its parts there will not be uniform
distension.</p>

<p>9. There should be 25 per cent. margin allowed for adhesion before
a belt begins to slip.</p></blockquote>

while lining up the faces, and then moved back to its original position as in fig. 451. When
the pulley is not easily shifted the distances at A and D (fig. 449) may be measured.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Rules for Calculating Speed and Sizes of Pulley.</b>&mdash;When
two pulleys are working together connected by a belt, the one
which communicates the motion is called the <i>driver</i> and the
other which receives it, the <i>driven pulley</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>To Find the Size of the Driving Pulley:</b> Multiply the diameter of
the driven pulley by its required number of revolutions, and divide
the product by the revolutions of the driver. The quotient will be the
diameter of the driver.</p>

<p><b>To Find the Number of Revolutions of the Driven Pulley:</b> Multiply
the diameter of the driver by its number of revolutions, and divide
by diameter of driven. The quotient will be the number of revolutions
of the driven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span></p>

<p><b>To Find the Diameter of the Driven that shall Make a Given
Number of Revolutions, the Diameter and Revolutions of the
Driver Being Given:</b> Multiply the diameter of the driver by its number
of revolutions, and divide the product by the number of revolutions of
the driven pulley. The quotient will be the diameter of the driven pulley.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Rope Drive.</b>&mdash;In this method of power transmission, rope is
run in V-shaped grooves in the rims of the pulleys; this form
of drive, in some cases, is more desirable than others.</p>

<div id="FIG_452" class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 452.&mdash;General Electric C Q back geared motor driving Hamilton sensitive drill. When
slowly moving machines are to be driven, or where, for any reason, very moderate belt
speeds are required, the back geared motor is desirable. Two ratios of gear reduction have
been adopted as standard; they are:&mdash;4 to 1 and 8 to 1.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What are some of the advantages of rope drive?</b></p>

<p>Ans. More power can be transmitted with a given diameter
and width of pulley, on account of the increased grip in the
grooves. Rope drive can be employed for long or short distances
by reason of its lightness and the action of the grooves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

<p><b>Gear Drive.</b>&mdash;This method is used where a positive drive is
desired, as for elevator or railway motors. It admits of any
degree of speed reduction without attending difficulties as would
be encountered with belt drive.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thus, with the worm type of gear as used on elevator motors a great
reduction in velocity can be made without incurring the expense of
countershaft as with a belt.</p></blockquote>

base (as shown) is furnished, the standard sliding base being used on a side wall. The
armature shaft may be extended for pulley or coupling either above or below the motor.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Friction Drive.</b>&mdash;This is a very simple mode of transmitting
power and has the advantages of simplicity and compactness.
In operation, the driving wheel is pressed against the wheel to
be driven, transmitting motion to the latter by the frictional
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
grip. The drive is thrown out of gear by slightly moving the
machine on its sliding base. In construction, the friction may
be increased by making one wheel of the pair of wood, compressed
paper, or leather.</p>

<p><b>Electrical Connections.</b>&mdash;Circuits for dynamos and motors
should be carefully planned so as to secure the simplest arrangement,
and to avoid unnecessary expense and delay, the wiring
should be installed in accordance with the requirements of the

<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to exposed and
concealed wiring?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Exposed wiring is cheap and accessible; a short circuit
or ground is easily located and repaired. Concealed wiring,
especially when placed under the floor, has the advantage of
being out of the way, and thus protected from injury.</p>

with respect to size of wire?</b></p>

<p>Ans. All conductors, including those connecting the machine
with the switchboard, as well as the bus bars on the latter,
should be of ample size to be free from overheating and excessive
loss of voltage. The drop between the generator and switchboard
should not exceed one-half per cent. at full load, because
it interferes with proper regulation and adds to the less easily
avoided drop on the distribution system.</p>

AUXILIARY APPARATUS</h2>


<p>There are numerous devices that must be used in connection
with dynamos and motors for proper control and safe operation.
Among these may be mentioned:</p>

<p>
1. Switches;<br />
2. Fuses;<br />
3. Circuit breakers;<br />
4. Rheostats;<br />
5. Switchboards.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Switches.</b>&mdash;A switch is a device by means of which an electric
circuit may be opened or closed. There are numerous types of
switch; they may be either single or multi-pole, single or
double-throw and either of the "snap" or knife form.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the difference between a single and
double-pole switch?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A single-pole switch controls only one of the wires of
the circuit, while a double-pole switch controls both.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the difference between a single-break
and a double-break switch?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The distinction is that the one breaks the circuit at one
point only, while the other breaks it at two points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the advantage of a double-break?</b></p>

<p>Ans. If the circuit be opened at two points in series at the
same instant, the electromotive force is divided between the two
breaks and the length to which the current will maintain an arc
at either break is reduced to one-half; thus there is less chance
of burning the metal of the switch. Another reason for providing
two breaks is to avoid using the blade pivot as a conductor, the
contact at this point being too poor for good conductivity.</p>

end. Fig. 458, single-pole switch; fig. 459, double-pole switch; fig. 460, three-pole switch.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. When should a knife switch be used?</b></p>

<p>Ans. When the capacity of the circuit in which it is to be
placed exceeds 10 amperes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe a knife switch.</b></p>

<p>Ans. <a href="#FIG_461">Fig. 461</a> illustrates a knife switch of the double-pole,
single-throw type. It consists of the following parts: base,
hinges, blades, contact jaws, insulating cross bar, and handle,
as shown.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How should knife switches be installed?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They should be placed so that <i>gravity tends to open
them</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Otherwise if the hinges become loose, the weight of the blades and
handle would tend to close the switch, thus closing the circuit and possibly
resulting in considerable damage.</p></blockquote>

<img src="images/fig461.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 461.&mdash;A single-throw, two pole knife switch.
As usually constructed it is made of hard-drawn copper with cast terminal
lugs and fibre cross bar.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How should switches be proportioned?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The minimum area of the contact surfaces should not
be less than .01 square inch per ampere, and in those used on arc
lighting or other high voltage circuits where the current is usually
small, the area of the contact surfaces are usually from .02 to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
.05 inch per ampere. Since dirt or oxidation would prevent
good contact under a simple pressure between the contact surfaces,
the mechanism of a switch provides a sliding contact.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the general design of switches, all parts which carry current are
given a cross sectional area of at least one square inch per 1,000 amperes
if they be made of copper, and about three times as much if made of
brass, as the conductivity of the latter is only one-third that of the
former. Furthermore, the current should never be permitted to pass
through springs, as the heat generated will destroy their elasticity.</p></blockquote>

<img src="images/fig462.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 462.&mdash;Triple-pole, double-break double-throw knife switch for very heavy current. The
blades are made up of numerous strips to give adequate contact area. A double-throw
switch is used when it is desirable to open one circuit and immediately close another, or to
transfer one or more connections from one circuit to another in the least practical interval
of time, also, when one connection is to be broken and another closed and it is undesirable
to allow both to be closed at the same time.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What difficulty is experienced in opening a
circuit in which a heavy current is flowing?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is impossible to instantly stop the current by opening
the switch, consequently the current continues to flow and
momentarily jumps the air gap, resulting in a more or less intense
arc which tends to burn the metal of the switch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How is this remedied to some extent?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The contact pieces are so shaped that they open along
their whole length at the same time, so as to prevent the concentration
of the arc at the last point of contact. This feature
is clearly shown in <a href="#FIG_461">fig. 461</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 463.&mdash;A "quick break" knife switch of the single-throw, single-break, one pole, type.
The contact blade is held between the jaws by their clamping friction until the handle
compresses the spring sufficiently to force the blade out. As soon as it breaks contact with
the jaws, the spring expands and drives the blade away from the jaws with greater rapidity
than could be done by hand. The object of this action is to break the arc as quickly as
possible to prevent burning the metal of the switch.</p>

<p><b>Ques. For what service are "snap" switches suitable?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are used on circuits containing lamps in comparatively
small groups, and other light duty service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What is a quick break switch?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A form of switch in which the contact pieces are snapped

make the duration of the arc as short as possible.</p>

<p>The current allowed in each branch circuit of an electric lighting
system is limited by the insurance rules to a maximum of 660 watts
equivalent to 12 lamps of 16 c.p. each at 110 volts. They are also
employed to control lamps in groups in theatres and other places where
many lamps are turned on or off at about the same time.</p></blockquote>

<img src="images/fig467.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 467.&mdash;Spool of fuse wire. The wire is usually made of an alloy of tin and lead, such as
half and half solder. Bismuth is frequently added to the alloy to lower the melting point
For half and half solder the melting point is 370&deg; Fahr. The quickness with which a fuse
will melt after the current has reached the limit depends upon the specific heat and latent
heat of the metal. The current required to "blow" a fuse increases somewhat with the
age of the fuse owing to oxidation and molecular changes. Fuses are sometimes rated
according to the number of amperes to be taken normally by the circuit they are to protect.
Thus, a 10 ampere fuse is supposed to protect a circuit whose regular current should not
exceed 10 amperes, and to blow if the current rise to say 12 amperes. The Underwriters'
rule requires that the rating be about 80% of the maximum current it can carry indefinitely,
thus allowing about 25% overload before the fuse melts. The fusing current varies considerably
according to circumstances. The temperature of the surrounding air or other
substances affects the melting current greatly, because the rate at which heat from the fuse
will be transferred to the surroundings depends upon the difference of temperance between
them and the fuse. Hence a fuse in a warm place will be melted by a smaller current than
a similar fuse in a cold place. For a similar reason, a fuse in an enclosed place where there
is little chance for the heat to be dissipated, will melt with a smaller current than the same
in an open place. If the current increase gradually to that which would ordinarily melt the
fuse, the high temperature makes the fuse wire oxidize rapidly; this sometimes makes a
sort of tube of oxide which will not break even after the fuse wire inside has melted, and
so the fuse carries more than its rated current. Open fuses are so unreliable that circuit
breakers are preferable for large currents; when fuses are used, the enclosed type as shown
in figs. 468 to 470, is usually the more desirable.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span></p>

<p><b>Fuses.</b>&mdash;All circuits subject to abnormal increase of current
which might overheat the system, should be protected by fuses
which will melt and thus open the circuit. A fuse is simply
a strip of fusible metal, often consisting of lead with a small
percentage of tin, connected in series in the circuit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Experiments have shown that for large fuses, a multiple fuse is more
sensitive than a single one. A one hundred ampere fuse may be made
by taking four wires of twenty-five amperes capacity. A fuse block may
be overloaded, not because the metal of the terminals is not of sufficient

contact, or loose contact of fuse and wires; the overload thus caused

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 471 to 478.&mdash;Interior construction of D. &amp; W. fuses. In the manufacture of these fuses,
four types of fuse link are used according to capacity of fuse, and classified as: 1, air drum
link; 2, flat link; 3, multiple link; 4, cylinder link. In the air drum link, figs. 471 and 472,
a capsule provides an air space about the center of the link, the rate of heat conduction
through the confined air being very slow, the temperature of that portion of the link rises
rapidly with increasing current, rendering the blowing point practically constant; fig. 473
shows a section through the complete fuse. In the flat link, fig. 474, the section is reduced
in the center, cutting down as far as possible the volume of metal to be fused. Figs. 475
to 478 show various form of multiple link construction. By subdividing the metal, increased
radiating surface is obtained which permits a reduction in the volume of fusible
metal necessary, and the metal vapor formed when the fuse blows on heavy overload is
more readily dissipated. Figs. 477 and 478 show two forms of the cylinder link, the plain
cylinder fig. 477, being used for low voltage and large current, and fig. 478, for certain
high tension service. The corrugated cylinder presents more surface to the fuse filling
than the plain type and secures a maximum radiating surface with resulting minimum
volume of metal for a given current.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How should fuses be mounted?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They should be placed on a base of slate, porcelain,
marble, or other incombustible material.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the objection to copper fuses?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They heat perceptibly soon after their rated capacity
is passed. The melting temperature is higher than lead alloy.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Upon what consideration does the choice between
switches and circuit breakers depend?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Simple knife switches are suitable for use when the
circuit is not liable to be opened while carrying large current. A
circuit breaker, operated automatically or by hand should be
used for interrupting heavy currents.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the construction of a circuit breaker?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is composed of a switch and a solenoid in the main
circuit. When the current, flowing through the circuit, exceeds
a certain value, the core of the solenoid is drawn in and trips a
trigger which allows the switch to fly open under the action of
a spring.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 489 and 490.&mdash;Front and top views of I-T-E automatic overload circuit breaker.
In fig. 489 the current in the circuit enters at A, passes through the solenoid coil B (which
in its iron jacket becomes a powerful magnet), through the copper terminal C, to the contact
blades D, across the bridge at E to the contact blades F, and out into the line at G. The
path of the current as indicated above is more clearly indicated in the top view fig. 490.
When the current in the solenoid coil produces sufficient magnetism to overcome the weight
of the plunger, the latter is drawn up with constantly increasing velocity until it strikes
a restraining latch or trigger which forces the arm out of the switch, thus automatically
opening the circuit. The device is so constructed that in opening the circuit the arc is
broken on the carbon contacts instead of the copper contacts.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. Describe a reverse current circuit breaker or
discriminating cut out.</b></p>

<p>Ans. This type of circuit breaker is arranged to open a circuit
in the event of current flowing in the circuit in a direction
reverse to the normal. This is sometimes effected by winding the
electromagnet of the circuit breaker with two coils, one connected
as a shunt across the main circuit and the other in series with the
main circuit, the two coils being so arranged that when the main
current flows in the normal direction their effects assist one
another, whereas, when the main current reverses, the effects of
the coils are neutralized and the breaker opens.</p>

<img src="images/fig491.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 491.&mdash;Roller-Smith "S.E." plain overload circuit breaker. In operation, current entering
through the lower studs flows through the laminated strap windings C, from this into
the arm D, through the contact plate E, into the stationary brush F, and finally out
through the upper stud Q. In its passage through the laminated windings C, the square
core A is of course magnetized to a degree dependent on the current strength. When this
magnetization reaches a predetermined value, the attraction exerted on the ends K of
the pivoted armature causes the same to rise with great and increasing velocity, finally
bringing the finger D which forms part of the armature into violent contact with the
face R of the corresponding projection on the housing which carries the handle and the
roller H. This heavy blow causes H, in its rotation about the shaft J, to go over the
center and consequently allows the strong outward pressure of the brush F and the
resilient coil C to throw the arm outward with a high velocity and so break the circuit,
first between the brush fingers and the contact plate and finally between the carbons S
and F, the one of which is rigidly secured to the arm and the other of which is resiliently
mounted on its supporting spring. To reset the breaker, the handle, which the act of
opening has raised, is pulled down, thus bringing roller H into engagement with roller G
once more and in that way forcing the arm back into its initial position.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 492.&mdash;Roller-Smith "S.E." combination overload and underload circuit breaker. Attached
to the supporting frame B is the extension Z, which like B, is of non-magnetic material
and carries a rectangular magnetic core around which there are wrapped laminated
copper conductors. Hinged at U is a heavy cup-shaped mass of magnetic material, and
hinged at V is a flat lever X which bears against the extension Y secured to the housing
which carries the operating handle. The circuit through the breaker conveys the current
around the windings of this underload coil carried by frame Z and passes from it to the
regular overload winding C from which it pursues the same course and exercises the same
function as in a plain overload breaker. The core of Z being thus magnetized, the cup-shaped
member W is held in firm contact therewith and the lever X hangs free. Should,
however, the current fall below the minimum value, W is no longer sustained by the
magnetic attraction but drops away, swinging on its hinge U until the projection on the
heel thereof strikes the lever X, which blow is transmitted through Y to the handle and
thus trips the breaker. When closing to reset the breaker, the handle is manipulated just
as in the case of a plain overload breaker, that is, it is pulled down, thus not only closing and
locking the breaker as before but through the pressure exerted by Y on X and by X on W,
putting the latter into contact with its rectangular core to which it will adhere if the
necessary current be present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. State some disadvantages of a discriminating
cut out.</b></p>

<p>Ans. If one current reverse very rapidly, and soon reach a
large value in the opposite direction, it is possible the cut out
may not open at the desired instant, and thereafter the effect of
the heavy reverse current will be so great that the breaker will
be held in more and more strongly; a second disadvantage is that
should the supply fail, the breaker will open in any case, and have
to be reset before the supply can be resumed, though in certain
cases, as, for instance where there is a motor load, this feature
is an advantage and not a disadvantage, since the breaker acts
as a no-voltage cut out as well as a reverse current cut out.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Reverse breakers, however, can be made positive in their action;
that is, they can be so arranged that a reverse current exerts a positive
pull on the tripping gear, so that the greater the reverse current, the
greater the tripping effect.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What are time limit attachments?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Devices which are fitted to circuit breakers and which
act as dampers and prevent the too sudden operation of the
breakers on what may be only a temporary overload or reverse
current.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By having different time limits on feeder and dynamo breakers it can
be ensured that the former operate before the latter, and suitably in
other cases where it is desired that one breaker shall operate before
another.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. Describe a time limit attachment.</b></p>

<p>Ans. There are numerous types. It may consist of a clockwork
device, a weight acting on a small drum or pulley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
a modified dash pot arrangement, or a device operating by the
expansion of a conductor due to the heat generated by a current
passing through it.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How should a time limit device be arranged?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It should be so arranged that the heavier the overload
the quicker the device acts, until with a short circuit the device
is almost instantaneous in its action.</p>

<img src="images/fig493.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 493.&mdash;Diagram showing connections of a rheostat. The various resistance coils are connected
to brass buttons or "contacts." The rheostat is connected in series in the circuit
that it is to control. In operation when the lever is on contact 1, the current is opposed
by all the resistance of the rheostat so that the flow is very small. As the lever is moved
over contacts 1, 2, 3, etc., the coils are successively cut out, thus diminishing the resistance,
and when contact 11 is reached all the resistance is short circuited allowing the full current
to flow. In some types of rheostat the wire is wound around an iron framework which has
been previously dipped into a fireproof insulating enamel. The advantage of this construction
is that the heat from the wire is dissipated much more rapidly, so that a much
smaller wire can be used to carry a given current. The size of such an enameled rheostat
required for absorbing a given amount of energy is much smaller than one made of coils
of wire stretched between an iron supporting framework.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Rheostats.</b>&mdash;These devices consist of conductors inserted into
a circuit for the purpose of diminishing, either constantly or in a
variable degree, the amount of current flowing, or to develop
heat by the passage of a current through them. Rheostats designed
to be used in starting electric motors are frequently called
"starting boxes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the construction of a rheostat.</b></p>

<p>Ans. In <a href="#FIG_493">fig. 493</a>, resistance coils, A, B, C, etc., are mounted
in a frame or box, and are connected at intervals to the contacts
1, 2, 3, etc. The rheostat arm or lever L is pivoted at S, and when
moved over the contacts, inserts more or less of the resistance
in the circuit thus regulating the flow of the current. One
terminal M of the rheostat is connected to the first contact and
the other terminal O, to the lever at S.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 494.&mdash;Starter with no voltage release for a series motor. A helical spring coiled around
the lever pivot P, and acting on the lever A, tends to keep it in the off position against the
stop S. This lever carries a soft iron armature I, which is held by the poles of the electromagnet
E, when, in starting the motor, the arm has been gradually forced over as far as it
will go. Should anything happen to interrupt the current while the motor M is running,
E will lose its magnetism and A will be released, and will fly over to the off position. E is
usually shunted by a small resistance R, so that only a portion of the main current flows
through it. This device constitutes the <i>no voltage release</i>, and ensures that all the resistance
is in circuit every time the motor is started.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How is a starting box connected to a motor?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In series.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Why should a starting box be used with a motor?</b></p>

<p>Ans. If the line voltage should be applied directly to the
terminals of the armature when not running, an excessive
flow of current will result, on account of the low resistance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
Accordingly, to prevent injury to the winding, a variable resistance
or starting box is inserted between one supply terminal
and the armature so that the pressure may be applied gradually
while the motor is coming up to speed.</p>

<img src="images/fig495.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 495.&mdash;Starter with no voltage release for a shunt motor. The terminals of the motor are
at M, M', <i>m</i>, and those of the starter at S, S', <i>s</i>. The lever SA is shown in the "on" position.
The current enters the motor at the terminal M, and there divides, part going through the
field coil F, and the main current through the motor armature A. The armature current
enters the starter at the terminal S', and traversing the lever SA, leaves by the terminal S.
The field current enters the starter at the terminal <i>s</i>, traverses the coil of the magnet E
(which holds up the armature <i>a</i> linked to the lever) and thence completes its journey
through the whole of the resistance R, and through the lever SA, to the terminal S. When
the supply is cut off by opening <span class="smcap">Sw</span>, or should the field circuit be accidentally broken, the
magnet E will release <i>a</i> and the lever, which will thereupon fly to the "off" stop O. It should
be noticed that when SA is off, A and F form a closed circuit with the resistance R and
magnet E. The inductance of F has consequently no chance of causing destructive sparking
when the current is shut off. In starting the motor, <span class="smcap">Sw</span> is first closed, and then, as the
lever is slowly moved, the resistance R, which at first is all in circuit with A, is gradually
transferred from A to F. The resistance of R is too small to affect appreciably the current
in F, which necessarily consists of a comparatively large number of turns of fine wire. The
arrangement is adopted to render the breaking of the shunt circuit unnecessary and is
rendered clearer by the diagram fig. 496. It should be noted that E may be provided with
a short circuiting key or push if required.</p>

With a shunt motor, the only difference in the diagram would be that the series winding
<span class="smcap">Se</span> would be absent, and the armature A would then be connected straight across between
the main terminals M and M'. When switch <span class="smcap">Sw</span> is closed, the current will enter the starter
at its terminal S, and pass through the magnet coil <i>m'</i> of the overload release to the switch
lever L, which is shown in the off position. As soon as L is moved up to make contact
with the first contact S the current divides; part going through the resistance R and the
terminals S' and M' to the series coil <span class="smcap">Se</span> (if a compound motor) and armature A; and part
through the no voltage magnet E to the shunt winding <span class="smcap">Sh</span>. As the lever L is moved up
toward E, the effect is to take R out of the armature circuit and put it into the shunt circuit.
When the iron armature <i>a</i>, fixed on the switch lever, comes against the poles of E,
the laminated copper brush C bears against the blocks B, B, and so affords a better path
for the current than through the spindle <i>s</i>. Should the supply voltage fail, either temporarily
or permanently, E will release <i>a</i>, and L will fly off under the tension of a helical
spring coiled round <i>s</i>. If there should be an overload on the motor, tending to pull it up
and cause an excess of current to flow through the armature; this excess current, passing
through <i>m'</i>, will make it attract its armature, so bringing two contacts together at K which
will short circuit E, and allow the switch to fly off. The connections between E and <i>m'</i>
are not shown in the figure, but they are indicated at C in <a href="#FIG_498">fig. 498</a>, which is a simplification
of <a href="#FIG_497">fig. 497</a>, and which should be carefully compared therewith. When only the normal
current is flowing, the attraction between <i>m'</i> and its armature is not sufficient to pull the
latter up. The actual forms and arrangement of parts on the starters are well shown in
some of the figures.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What attachments should be provided on a
starting box?</b></p>

<p>Ans. An overload release, and a no voltage release.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe these devices.</b></p>

<p>Ans. The overload release is an electromagnetic circuit
breaker that opens the circuit if the motor become greatly
overloaded. A no voltage release may consist of an electromagnet
in series with the shunt field circuit; it holds the rheostat arm
in the operating position as long as current flows through the
shunt field from the line. If the line switch be opened or the shunt
field circuit accidentally broken, the device becomes demagnetized
and releases the arm, which returns to its starting position by
the action of a spring.</p>

<p>The general arrangement of switches, cut outs and starting
boxes should be in accordance with the requirements of the
National Electrical Code as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Each motor and starting box must be protected by a cut out and
controlled by a switch, said switch plainly indicating whether 'on' or
'off.' The switch and rheostat must be located within sight of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
motor, except in cases where
special permission to locate
them elsewhere is given, in
writing by the inspection department
having jurisdiction.</p>

<p>"Where the circuit breaking
device on the motor
starting rheostat discs disconnects
all wires of the circuit,
this switch may be omitted.</p>

<p>"Overload release devices
on motor starting rheostats
will not be considered to take
the place of the cut out required
if they be inoperative
during the starting of the
motor.</p>

<p>"The switch is necessary
for entirely disconnecting the
motor when not in use, and
the cut out to protect the
motor from excessive currents,
or careless handling
when starting. An automatic
circuit breaker disconnecting
all wires of the circuit, may,
however, serve as both switch
and cut out."</p></blockquote>

switchboard. The wires are shown to illustrate
the various connections, but in actual construction
these wires are connected on the back of the
switchboard.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Switchboards.</b>&mdash;A
switchboard consists of a
panel or series of panels of
slate, marble, soapstone or
brick tile erected in an
electric plant for the purpose
of mounting in a convenient
group the instruments
for controlling and
distributing the current
and safeguarding the system.
Switchboards may
be divided according to
operation into two classes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span></p>

<p>
1. Direct control;<br />
2. Remote control.<br />
</p>

<p>A direct control switchboard has all its apparatus mounted
directly on the board and controlled by hand, while in the remote
control type, the main current carrying parts are at some distance
from the operating board, the control being effected by mechanical
devices or by electric motors or solenoids. When the control
system of a plant is very extensive, it sometimes occupies a
separate building known as the <i>switch house</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to the material
for switchboards?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In order to avoid danger of fire from short circuits, the
panel should be made of some non-combustible material, such as
marble, slate, glass plates or earthenware tiles. If slate be used,
care should be taken to have it free from conducting veins, or it
should be marbleized, that is, subjected to a treatment that will
fill up the pores of the veins and thus prevent the absorption of
moisture.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wood is seldom used, except in cases where the switches, fuse blocks,
wire supports, etc., are all mounted on porcelain or other incombustible
material.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How should the instruments and connections
be arranged on a switchboard?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They should be arranged so as to provide the shortest
possible path for the current, and preferably always in the same
direction, that is, from right to left or from top to bottom, the
connecting wires being brought in on one side and out on the
other, and the crossing of wires avoided as far as possible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All wires and current carrying parts should be kept far enough apart
at all points to prevent accidental contact or the jumping across of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
current where there is a great difference of voltage. Such wires should
be also kept at a sufficient distance from screw heads, metal brackets,
gas pipes, water pipes, and other conducting bodies, in order to prevent
accidental grounds or short circuits.</p>

<p>All instruments and switches should be placed so as to be conveniently
accessible for observation and operation, and sufficiently out of reach of
accidental contact by persons; otherwise they should be protected by
some form of insulating shield.</p></blockquote>

is a voltmeter switch connecting the voltmeter with various parts
of the system. Below the voltmeter switch is a double-throw
switch to transfer the bus bars from connection with the dynamo
switches to one with some other source of current such as a street
circuit, in the event of a breakdown. At the bottom are two
circuit breakers.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the voltmeter switch.</b></p>

<p>Ans. <a href="#FIG_501">Fig. 501</a> shows the connections, from which it can be
seen that the voltmeter can be connected with the terminals of
either dynamo or with the bus bars, or with either a central or
remote part in the lamp circuits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Under ordinary conditions it remains connected to the circuit at the
central point of distribution. When one dynamo is already in circuit,
however, and it becomes necessary to connect up the other one, the voltage
of the latter must be the same as that at the bus bars. Accordingly,
connections are provided to the voltmeter switch such that the attendant
can compare the voltages at the dynamo terminals and bus bars before
closing the dynamo switch. All the positive connections are on one
side of the circle swept by the switch and all the negative connections
on the other side.</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 502.&mdash;Roller-Smith, single-pole, plain overload circuit breaker. As its name indicates,
the function of the plain overload circuit breaker is to automatically interrupt the circuit
in which it is placed when the flow of current through it exceeds the predetermined
limit for which the apparatus is set. It is the most common of all of the types and is
utilized for the protection of dynamos and motors and all other electrical apparatus which,
by reason of the conditions of operation, may become subject to loads in excess of the
normal. The single-pole type may be used separately for the protection of a single wire
of a given circuit or grouped to protect the two or more wires of one circuit, becoming in
the latter case the so called independent arm multi-pole apparatus. The action of this
type of circuit breaker is fully explained in <a href="#FIG_491">fig. 491</a>.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
